<small>DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> towering stacks of the steamboat
&#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; sent their clouds of smoke,
black and wind rent, across the sky; her
sharp bow cut the yellow waters of the
Mississippi and dashed the spray as high as
her rails.</p>

<p>The cabins were thronged with passengers;
the forward deck was tiered high with
bales and barrels and boxes of merchandise.</p>

<p>Two boys sat by the rail upon the upper
deck; their faces were earnest and they
talked in low tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure that Sam Davidge
is on board, Walt?&#8221; asked one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d know him among a whole city-full,
let alone a cabin-full,&#8221; answered Walter
Jordan. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve seen him three times
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other boy frowned and looked out
over the wide river toward the Arkansas
shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s very queer
that he should just happen to be going
down the river at the same time we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Jordan gave his friend a quick
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ned,&#8221; said he, &#8220;chance has nothing to
do with it&mdash;as I think you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Chandler nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on board because we are; he&#8217;s trying
to find out where we are going.&#8221; The
boy ran his fingers through his short light
hair, and his blue eyes snapped. &#8220;I never
did think much of Davidge; and I think
less of him now than I did before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Jordan leaned back in his chair
and clasped one knee with his hands. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
was a tall, well-built young fellow of eighteen
with a broad chest and shoulders, and
a good-looking, resolute face.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we boarded the &#8216;General Greene&#8217;
at Louisville,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I thought I saw
Davidge in the crowd. But you know what
a miserable, wet night it was and how the
lamps on the pier flickered. So I couldn&#8217;t
be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never mentioned it to me,&#8221; said
Ned, complainingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to until I was sure. I
thought there was no use getting up an
excitement about a thing that might turn
out to have nothing behind it.&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere around the high tiers
of bales, a negro deck hand picked a tune
out of a banjo; and the rhythmic shuffle
and pit-pat-pit of feet told of another who
danced to the music.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the way down the Ohio on the
&#8216;Greene&#8217; I noticed you were very quiet and
watchful,&#8221; spoke young Chandler. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to me it only meant that you were careful.
I never thought of anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Jordan looked at his friend, and
there was a troubled look in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Sam Davidge isn&#8217;t all we have to
worry us,&#8221; said he, in a lower tone. &#8220;When
we reached the Mississippi, and changed to
this boat, I noticed something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned caught the troubled look, and though
he did not in the least suspect the cause of it,
his own round face took on one just like it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen a man on board whom
they all call Colonel Huntley?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned&#8217;s eyes went to the cabin door where
he had noticed two persons a few moments
before; the two were still there and intently
examining them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;I know whom you
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand it, and I don&#8217;t like
it,&#8221; said Walter, the troubled look growing
deeper, &#8220;but there is never a time I look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
toward him that I don&#8217;t find his eyes upon
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Ned. And then: &#8220;Well,
Walt, he&#8217;s not changed his ways any.
Don&#8217;t look around just yet, or he&#8217;ll see that
we&#8217;ve been speaking of him. He&#8217;s over by
the cabin door behind you, and he&#8217;s looking
this way for all he&#8217;s worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That fellow Barker is with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barker&#8217;s like his shadow,&#8221; said Walter.
&#8220;You never see one without the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Huntley was a man of perhaps
forty years, tall and powerfully built. He
wore a long frock coat of gray cloth, doe-skin
trousers, and long shining boots. Upon
his head was a bell-crowned beaver hat with
a curling brim. In the immaculately white
stock about his neck was a large diamond
set in rough gold.</p>

<p>The person beside him was a young fellow
of perhaps twenty, with huge, thick shoulders
and a round bullet head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Ned, his eyes upon the
two but his mind, apparently, upon a subject
altogether foreign to them, &#8220;do you
think Colonel Huntley has anything to do
with Davidge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure of it,&#8221; replied Walter.
&#8220;When either of us is about, Sam keeps
hidden. But when the coast&#8217;s clear, or they
think it is, he is to be seen in out-of-the-way
corners, earnestly discussing something with
Colonel Huntley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that I&#8217;ve been missing a great
deal,&#8221; said young Chandler. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
past. In the future I&#8217;m going to keep both
eyes wide open. Earnest conversation in
out-of-the-way corners means only one
thing. And that is: that something is
under way which has a good bit to do with
our trip to Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence for a space. Ned continued
covertly to inspect the two at the
cabin door. Walter gazed ahead along the
broad stretch of the Mississippi; on the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
was the thickly timbered shore of Tennessee;
and that of Arkansas frowned at them from
the right.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; was a large boat;
she was deeply loaded with cargo and carried
a great throng of passengers. But passengers
were always plentiful in those early
days of the year 1836; for the situation between
Texas and Mexico had grown acute;
war had spread its sombre wings for a terrible
flight across that new land; the adventurers
and soldiers of fortune of the
States were swarming toward the southwest.</p>

<p>Those men who had fought in the many
wars with the Indians, who had carried the
line of the frontier forward step by step,
who had leveled the wilderness and subdued
the forces which spring up in the path
of civilization, had long ago turned their
eyes toward the vast empire north of the
Rio Grande. They saw it loosely held by
an inferior race; they saw a hardy, fearless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
band of Americans resisting oppression and
preparing to repulse the advance of Santa
Anna. And so each steamer down the
Mississippi carried a horde of them, armed
and ready to do their part.</p>

<p>Since boarding the boat the boys had
heard little else but Texas. The name
seemed to be on every tongue. And even
now, as they sat thinking over the turn
that seemed to have taken place in their
own affairs, the loud voices that came to
their ears from the cabin held to the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pack of mongrels, that&#8217;s what they
are,&#8221; said a voice above the clatter. &#8220;And
not a good fight among them. The idea of
their trying to dictate to a free people like
the Texans what shall and what shall not
be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another man seemed stunned by the immense
area of the new land.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think of the size of it!&#8221; cried he,
in high admiration. &#8220;Eight hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
twenty-five miles long, and seven hundred
and forty miles wide. It&#8217;s twice as big as
Great Britain and Ireland, and bigger than
France, Holland, Belgium and Denmark
put together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says a country like that is not
worth fighting for?&#8221; shouted another voice.
&#8220;Who says it shouldn&#8217;t belong to these
United States?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Santa Anna poke his nose across the
Coahuila line, and he&#8217;ll get it cut off with a
bowie knife,&#8221; said still another adventurer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Walter Jordan,
&#8220;that we couldn&#8217;t have had a worse time to
carry out our errand to Texas than just
now. The closer we get to it, the more war-like
things are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Chandler looked at his friend in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Walter,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;re not
holding back because things are not all quiet
and orderly, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m headed for Texas, and going as fast
as this boat will take me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
I mean to keep on going until I get there
and do what we set out to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned laughed in a pleased sort of way.
There was a light of adventure in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you object to the coming war
with the Mexicans, then?&#8221; said he. &#8220;That
will make only the more fun on our trip
south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But fun is not what we&#8217;ve come for,&#8221;
said Walter. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a purpose in view,
and until that&#8217;s accomplished, we must
think of nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned grew more sober.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Not a thing
must enter our minds but the one thing,
until it&#8217;s done. But after that,&#8221; and his
eyes began to dance once more, &#8220;we can
take time to look around us a bit, can&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose that would do no harm.
But mind you, Ned, not until then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;Not for a moment,&#8221; said Ned Chandler.
&#8220;You can count on me, Walt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence between them,
and once more the voices came from the
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the settlement of Texas from
start to finish,&#8221; said the loud-voiced man.
&#8220;First the French built a fort; then they
left, and the Spanish came and built missions,
and called the state the New Philippines,
and began to fight the Comanche and
Apache. When the United States bought
the Louisiana territory from France, trouble
began with Spain. We claimed everything
north of the Rio Grande; but the Spaniards
said the Sabine was the natural
line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I recall the things that followed that,&#8221;
said another voice. &#8220;I was quite a youngster
then, and was in New Orleans. Every
little while expeditions were formed to invade
Texas and fight the Spanish. One, I
remember, was while the war with England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
was going on; and the Spanish were licked,
losing a thousand men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Steve Austin went into the territory
and planted a colony,&#8221; went on the
first speaker. &#8220;The new Mexican republic
stuck Coahuila on to Texas and tried to
make one state of them. But when the
Americans in the country got a little
stronger they rebelled against this, passed a
resolution and sent it to Santa Anna, asking
that Texas be admitted into the republic
as a separate state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might have known that he
wouldn&#8217;t listen to such a thing,&#8221; said the
other man. &#8220;&#8216;The Napoleon of the West&#8217;
he likes to be called, but a more detestable
tyrant never oppressed an honest
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when he tried to go against the
will of Texas, they gave him right smart
whippings at Goliad and Concepcion,
elected Smith governor, and Sam Houston
commander of the army. Then they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
smashed into San Antonio and ran the
Mexicans out of Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing will ever come of it until they
cut away from Mexico for good and all,&#8221;
said the second man. &#8220;I&#8217;m not for Texas
as an independent state in the Mexican Republic.
What I want to see, and what
thousands of others want to see, is Texas, a
republic itself, entirely free of Mexico, or
else Texas, a state in our own Union.&#8221;</p>

<p>This saying met with much favor; the
babble of voices arose, mingled with the
clapping of hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; went on the speaker, raising his
voice that he might be heard, &#8220;as long as
they stick to Mexico, just that long will
they keep in hot water. Santa Anna may
be, at this minute, marching against them
with an army. And he will keep on
marching against them until they make
themselves altogether independent of him
and his gang.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Walter Jordan arose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go inside,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They all
seem to be quite interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned also got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think there will ever be such a
thing as the Texas republic?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Walter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say. But if the Texans are
anything at all like what I hear they are,
it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it came about some
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they turned toward the cabin door,
and Walter found himself face to face with
Colonel Huntley.</p>

<small>THE PLOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Huntley</span> had cold gray eyes
which, when he chose, had an insult in
their every glance. And now, as Walter
Jordan&#8217;s eyes met his, he never stirred from
the cabin door. Quietly the lad stood and
looked at him; and the cold, valuing eyes
were filled with mockery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want anything?&#8221; he asked,
sneeringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to go into the cabin,&#8221; replied the
boy. &#8220;Will you kindly step out of the
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Huntley laughed in an unpleasant
manner, but did not move.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you somewhere
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re the son of Carroll Jordan,
attorney, at Louisville?&#8221; said Colonel
Huntley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew your father,&#8221; sneered Huntley.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you did,&#8221; came the boy&#8217;s swift reply,
&#8220;you knew one of the finest gentlemen in
Kentucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mockery in Huntley&#8217;s eyes increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends altogether on how one
looks at it,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>When Walter Jordan spoke there was a
ring in his voice which Ned Chandler knew
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looked at in the right way,&#8221; said the
lad, &#8220;and by that I mean the way in which
any fair and honest person would look at
it, there can be only one opinion. And that
is the one which I have given.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bullet-headed young man grinned
widely, showing a row of strong teeth, with
wide spaces between them. He nodded to
Colonel Huntley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s talking,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Right to
your face, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Huntley had a satisfied look in his face;
his cold eyes examined Walter from head
to foot. Ned Chandler plucked at his
friend&#8217;s sleeve, and breathed into his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! He&#8217;s trying to get you into
some kind of a muss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; spoke Huntley, and his tones were
as cold as his eyes, &#8220;you don&#8217;t consider me
either fair or honest, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter met the man&#8217;s look steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not mentioned you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
referred to those persons who might, as you
suggested, speak ill of my father. <i>You</i> have
not said what you thought, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Huntley laughed his unpleasant
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are something of a diplomat,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Or, had I better say, a dodger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, if I cared to,&#8221; said Walter, quietly,
&#8220;I might say almost the same thing of yourself.
Put yourself on record&mdash;say openly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
what you mean, and I will give you an answer,
plain enough for you or anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence after the boy&#8217;s bold
words. Ned Chandler&#8217;s eyes snapped with
delight, for here was a chance for excitement.
Colonel Huntley hesitated&mdash;not at
all because he had not a ready word or act,
but apparently because he feared to trust
himself. It was his bullet-headed companion
who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of your father,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told of the little game he&#8217;s up
to; and I think he&#8217;s trying to feather his
own nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently stung to the quick, young
Jordan whirled upon the speaker, his hand
drawn back for a blow. But he felt an iron
clutch on his wrist, and saw the burly chief
mate of the &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of that,&#8221; said the mate, sternly.
&#8220;No fighting here. There are women passengers,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bullet-headed youth had stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
aside at Walter&#8217;s first swift motion; this
left a space in the cabin doorway, and seizing
the chance, Ned Chandler crowded his
friend through and pushed him along the
full length of the men&#8217;s cabin, in spite of
his efforts to halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the light-haired boy, when
they finally brought up in an unoccupied
corner, &#8220;before you say anything, let me
tell you what I think.&#8221; He shoved his
hands down into his trousers pockets, and
eyed his friend calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were a little excited out there,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and maybe you didn&#8217;t see what I saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw that Colonel Huntley deliberately
set out to insult me,&#8221; said Walter, his eyes
glinting with anger, his fists clenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Ned, coolly. &#8220;So he
did. And more than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter looked at his friend, for in his
tone he noted a something which attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;The whole thing was arranged,&#8221; said
Ned, nodding his head assuredly. &#8220;Those
two planted themselves in the doorway to
wait for you. Colonel Huntley was to provoke
you, and that fellow Barker was to
step in at the right moment and pick a
fight with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter threw up his hand and his angry
eyes sought the length of the men&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, his hands tightly
clenched, &#8220;it&#8217;s not too late, if he&#8217;s still
of the same mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ned Chandler shook his head; apparently
he did not agree with his friend&#8217;s
present humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how you must feel,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;to hear your father badly spoken of in a
thing like this. He&#8217;s giving his money
and his time and his learning to do a thing
which will never bring him a penny of
gain. He&#8217;s sending you on a mission to
a distant place like Texas, just because
he wants to see right done. And to hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
people say things, like those Huntley and
Barker have said, is hard to bear. But
you must bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not!&#8221; said Walter steadily, his
eyes still searching the cabin for the two
men.</p>

<p>As a rule, young Jordan was the cooler
and more thoughtful of the two boys.
Ned was the impulsive one, the plunger
into adventure, a rollicking, harum-scarum
youngster. But, so it seemed, what had
been said against his father had stirred
Walter deeply and made him throw his
usual caution aside. And seeing this, Ned,
who was observant enough when he was
so inclined, had seized the helm and was
now guiding the craft of their fortunes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such people as those,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;are
of the sort who make a business of bullying.
They try to browbeat every one they
meet; and they are encouraged by people&#8217;s
giving in to them. And I don&#8217;t mean to
do that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;That Barker has a bad look,&#8221; said Ned,
&#8220;and he&#8217;s a pretty strong-looking fellow.
No, no,&#8221; hastily, as he caught sight of the
expression that came into his friend&#8217;s face,
&#8220;of course his strength wouldn&#8217;t make any
difference to you. But take a look at it
from the other side. These two haven&#8217;t
planned this thing with just the idea of
getting you into a fight. They are deeper
than that.&#8221; He put his hand upon Walter&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said he, in a lower tone,
&#8220;you were hurt. What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter looked at young Chandler, and
gradually the expression of his face changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our trip to Texas would be delayed,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;And they would
get there ahead of you; and the thing your
father is so set on doing for this girl in
Texas would never be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anger had now altogether left Walter
Jordan&#8217;s face; he laid his hand upon Ned&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I see it now.
That&#8217;s just what they are after. And I see
Sam Davidge&#8217;s hand in it. He&#8217;s planned
it with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sat down upon chairs in the
corner to discuss this new aspect. The
men&#8217;s cabin was crowded with all sorts of
travelers; and the clatter and rumble of
voices went on with the regularity of the
engine&#8217;s throb. Almost every walk of life
was represented among the passengers.
Planters on the way down the river to
Natchez or New Orleans; sharpers on the
lookout for some easy means of gaining
money; slave dealers, the sellers of plantation
requirements, steamboat men, drovers,
adventurers and desperadoes on their way
to the new country&mdash;Texas.</p>

<p>These latter were easily known by their
dress and manner. Some were elegantly
attired in the fashion of the time, others
wore flannel shirts and wide-rimmed hats,
and had the legs of their trousers stuffed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
into long leather boots. Still another class
possessed the hunting shirt, deerskin leggings
and coonskin cap of the backwoodsman.
All were armed with pistol, knife
and rifle; and all had the free, loud,
independent ways of their kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Texas,&#8221; declared the man with the
strong voice which the lads had heard
while upon the deck, &#8220;was never made for
Mexicans. It&#8217;s a great country, and none
but white men are fit to own it. I, for one,
am going down there with a rifle that can
snuff out a candle at fifty yards, and I&#8217;m
going to have a personal word for Santa
Anna if I ever run across him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shout went up from the adventurers,
rifle butts rattled upon the cabin floor and
brawny fists thumped tables and the arms
of chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re shouting!&#8221; cried another
man, a lank backwoodsman in a fringed
buckskin shirt. &#8220;Let them stop palavering
and get to work. Greasers&#8217;ll never do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
anything but talk if you talk with them.
Lead&#8217;s my way of conversing with such
folks&mdash;lead out of a rifle barrel, and with a
good eye behind it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the committee that&#8217;s got charge
of things doing down there?&#8221; asked a booted
and burly man in a soiled flannel shirt and
a huge Remington revolver sticking in his
belt. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t they get to some kind
of an agreement, and let Sam Houston
loose to march against the Greasers. As
my friend here says, talk&#8217;s no good, if it&#8217;s
not backed up by rifles. What they need
is to give Houston about five thousand men
who know how to shoot, and in three
months&#8217; time you&#8217;ll never hear another
word from Santa Anna and his gang.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they talked, the boys kept their
eyes fixed upon the people in the cabin,
watching for Huntley or his shadow.
Just then the whistle of the steamboat
shrieked and the engine slowed down in
answer to the pilot&#8217;s bell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;re about to make a landing,&#8221; said
Ned, his gaze going to a window. &#8220;See
how near the Tennessee shore is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a place called Randolph,&#8221; said a
planter who sat near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to take on some passengers, I
suppose,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And while the boat&#8217;s doing that,&#8221; said
Walter, steadily watching two figures who
were pushing their way through the
crowded cabin toward them, &#8220;I think you
and I&#8217;ll be entertaining Colonel Huntley
and his friend Mr. Barker.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>THE QUARREL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ned Chandler</span> looked toward the place
indicated by his friend and, sure enough,
he saw Huntley and Barker approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; said Ned, warningly, but
with his blue eyes snapping. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get
yourself hurt. But if they crowd trouble
on you, don&#8217;t step back. Give them all
they want.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Walter Jordan expected Colonel Huntley
to open hostilities when he approached,
he merely showed that he did not know
the methods of that gentleman. As a matter
of fact, Huntley did not appear to
notice either of the two young fellows;
Barker, however, gave Walter a lowering
sidelong look as he took a vacant chair
near the one newly occupied by the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Huntley,&#8221; said one of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
near by, &#8220;it&#8217;s rather a surprise to see you
on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to be, up to a very few
days ago,&#8221; said the colonel. He placed his
feet, with insolent deliberation, upon the
small table upon which young Jordan was
leaning, and began to slap at his boot leg
with the light stick which he carried. &#8220;A
thing came up which I had to attend to in
a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Going down to
New Orleans, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Colonel Huntley, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cold eyes of the man, as he said this,
fixed themselves upon Walter; the sneer
was once more upon his lips. The young
fellow regarded him with no trace of the
hot anger of a short time before; nevertheless
there was that in his manner which said
as plainly as words that he was no more inclined
to accept an affront then than he had
been before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said the steady, watchful eyes.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll say nothing if I&#8217;m not pushed to it.
But, you know, there&#8217;s a line which you
must not cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man whom Huntley addressed looked
amazed at his statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Texas!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;Why, I had
no idea that you were interested in the
liberation of that territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Colonel Huntley and Barker
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;My mission
is something else.&#8221; He looked at the
other inquiringly. &#8220;You remember Tom
Norton, who once ran a newspaper at Nashville?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Very well.
And his wife and little daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom went to Texas,&#8221; said Huntley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understood he started another paper
at Natchez,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>Huntley nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did. But like the one at Nashville,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
it didn&#8217;t last long. He took his family to
Texas, and settled at San Antonio. Both
Tom and his wife are dead. The girl is
grown up and is still at San Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the other, and looked at
Huntley with the expression of a man who
knows that more is coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Norton had some rich relations at Louisville;
they&#8217;ve gone too, and have left a fortune
to the girl, who knows nothing at all
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you are on your way to San
Antonio to tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to tell her; and also to keep her
out of the clutches of a hawk of a Louisville
lawyer who&#8217;s interested himself in the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Chandler looked at his friend; but
Walter was still quiet and still had the
steady look in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; thought Ned. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
not do anything unless they force him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the planter, who was conversing
with Colonel Huntley, &#8220;the birds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
prey have smelled out the money, have
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the colonel, switching at
his boot leg with the stick. &#8220;As soon as
the news went abroad that there was a rich
haul to be had, this particular shark began
to stir himself. He claims to be the executor
of the estate; he has a lot of useless papers,
and has sent emissaries to Texas to get possession
of the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The planter laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s energetic, at all events,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;But what&#8217;s his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jordan,&#8221; answered Huntley.</p>

<p>An exclamation of surprise came from the
planter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Carroll Jordan!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; said Huntley, nodding.</p>

<p>&#8220;You amaze me,&#8221; said the planter.
&#8220;This is the first time I ever heard anything
said against Counsellor Jordan. As
far as I&#8217;ve ever been able to learn, he&#8217;s rated
as high as justice itself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Huntley shook his head; from the corners
of his cold eyes he watched the young
man opposite him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the public thinks,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And the public seldom gets at the truth
of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The planter seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; said he, not at all convinced.
&#8220;But somehow I can&#8217;t get it into
my mind as a fact. If you were talking
of a sharper such as Sam Davidge, that
other Louisville attorney, I could understand
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Chandler noted the expression that
crossed the face of Colonel Huntley at this
and he choked back a chuckle. Young
Jordan leaned forward, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir,&#8221; said he to the
planter; &#8220;but it might interest you to
know that, in the case you are discussing,
Sam Davidge is on the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>The planter seemed surprised both at
the statement and at Walter&#8217;s interruption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
His eyes went to Huntley. But the latter
said nothing. It was Barker who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said the bullet-headed personage
to young Jordan. &#8220;What do you
mean by forcing yourself into a conversation
which does not concern you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young fellow looked at him, still
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are mistaken,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;The conversation does concern me intimately.&#8221;
Then turning to the planter he
added, &#8220;You&#8217;ll understand that, sir, when
I tell you that I am the son of Carroll
Jordan whom Colonel Huntley has seen fit
to slander.&#8221;</p>

<p>Huntley&#8217;s cold eyes stared into those of
the speaker; he lounged back in his chair,
and when he spoke his voice was menacing.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the second time in the last half
hour,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you&#8217;ve taken occasion
to rub me the wrong way. If you were
well acquainted with me you wouldn&#8217;t do
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;I think,&#8221; returned the young man,
calmly, &#8220;that I am as well acquainted with
you as I care to be. Your method of doing
things, Colonel Huntley, is not to my taste.
I dislike a man who sets out to insult some
one whom he&#8217;s opposed to, and then steps
aside so that some one in his pay may do
the dirty work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; snarled Barker, rising to
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your plan, Colonel Huntley,&#8221; went on
Walter Jordan, disregarding the bullet-headed
young man entirely, and addressing
himself to his principal, &#8220;is rather a
good one, as plans go. You would get the
result you are after, and yet would not actively
figure in the matter. I suppose Sam
Davidge arranged that with you in the secret
consultations you&#8217;ve been having in the
last little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barker, an ugly expression upon his face,
tapped young Jordan on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk to me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve said I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
do some one&#8217;s dirty work; and so I&#8217;m
going to give you a chance to prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here Ned Chandler pushed himself
between the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a few minutes,&#8221; said he to Barker,
and there was no mistaking his meaning,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll have everything proved to your
satisfaction, and in any way you care to
have it done. So step back and don&#8217;t
worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole thing,&#8221; proceeded Jordan to
Colonel Huntley, and still in the coolest
possible manner, &#8220;looks like one of Davidge&#8217;s
shrewd tricks. He knew, somehow,
where I was going. He followed,
skulking in the background. In some way
he must prevent my getting to Texas. He
took you into his council. You had a way.
You&#8217;d provoke me into a quarrel and then
set this hound on me,&#8221; pointing to the
snarling Barker, &#8220;in the hope that he&#8217;d injure
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly Colonel Huntley took his booted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
feet from off the table; with equal slowness
he arose to his feet. His cold, light eyes
had the deadly look that comes into those
of the cat tribe when about to spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve listened to what you&#8217;ve had to
say,&#8221; said he, evenly. &#8220;And now you will
listen to me. You&#8217;ve openly and deliberately
insulted me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The palm of young Jordan&#8217;s hand came
down with a smack upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the insulted one,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
put yourself in my way a while ago to insult
me. You followed me here to renew your
slander when I tried to avoid you. But
what I have said concerning you is the
truth. You are associated with Davidge in
his plot to get possession of Ethel Norton&#8217;s
estate. I charge you with that to your
teeth; and here I am to back it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cold look in Huntley&#8217;s face was now
one of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were old enough and worth my
attention in a practical way,&#8221; said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
calmly, &#8220;I&#8217;d take you ashore and shoot you
after the accepted code. But as I can&#8217;t
bother myself with you, I&#8217;ll turn you over
to my friend here; for you have affronted
him as much as you have myself. And
perhaps he&#8217;ll care to pay some attention to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Chandler grinned at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still sticking to your little arrangement,
eh, colonel?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Ah, well,
there&#8217;s nothing in the world like being
steadfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Huntley can suit himself in
this thing,&#8221; said Barker, his heavy face
fixed in a scowl. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll do the same.
If it&#8217;s his notion to pass this matter by, all
very well. But I will not. You&#8217;ve said
something to me, and about me, that was
meant to be offensive; and you&#8217;ve got to
give me satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the progress of this altercation,
all other conversation in the cabin of the
&#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; had gradually ceased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
All eyes were now upon Water Jordan and
the threatening figure of Barker; for it
looked as though the bullet-headed one
would spring at the young fellow&#8217;s throat
at any instant. And the idea of an impending
fight was pleasing to the wild
spirits which crowded the boat; for conflict
was the breath of their nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the fellow who&#8217;s looking so
tarnation mad?&#8221; asked a lank backwoodsman
who nursed a long rifle across his
knees. &#8220;He puts his head down like a
wild buffalo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His name&#8217;s Barker,&#8221; said a traveler.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been up and down the river for the
last five years, and in that time he&#8217;s gained
a wide reputation as a rough-and-tumble
fighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him,&#8221; spoke a flannel-shirted
adventurer, hitching at the belt
which supported a pair of huge revolvers.
&#8220;Almost killed a man at Nashville not
long ago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;The other one don&#8217;t look to be the same
kind of a critter,&#8221; said the backwoodsman.
&#8220;Kind of better bred and not so rugged in
the shoulders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks as though he could give a
good account of himself, though,&#8221; put in
the commercial drummer. &#8220;I&#8217;d give a nice
sum to see Barker beaten soundly. He&#8217;s
got the reputation of being the most troublesome
bruiser on the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221;
swung toward the Tennessee shore; the
negro roustabouts upon the wharf stood
ready to carry and trundle aboard the
miscellaneous articles of cargo which
awaited the craft. A thin array of passengers
was also waiting. Upon the decks
of the steamboat stood the captain and his
mates; their orders were given curtly and
the deck hands sprang alertly to obey
them.</p>

<p>Noting the boat&#8217;s proximity to the shore,
Colonel Huntley said something to Barker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
in a low voice. Barker&#8217;s eyes went to a
cabin window as though in reply to some
suggestion and an evil look came into his
dull face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us see,&#8221; said he to Walter, &#8220;if you
are as ready with your fists as you are with
your tongue. The officers of the boat don&#8217;t
care to have any trouble aboard, so, as we&#8217;ll
tie up to a wharf in a few minutes, let&#8217;s
take our affairs ashore, and have it out
without any interference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Ned Chandler. &#8220;That
suits us down to the ground. Let it be
ashore, by all means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Acting upon one impulse the passengers
streamed out upon the deck; there was a
hurrying of deck hands, a sharp calling of
orders and the jingling of the pilot&#8217;s bell.
Then with a great splashing of her wheels
and a straining of hawsers, the &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221;
lay quietly at the wharf.</p>

<p>Instantly the gangplank was run out
and the singing negroes began to roll on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the cargo. Walter Jordan and Ned vaulted
over the rail; a horde of passengers followed,
among them being Colonel Huntley
and Barker.</p>

<small>THE FIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the head of the wharf was an open
space, and when they reached this Barker
halted, and stripped off his coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use going any farther, gentlemen,&#8221;
said he with a wicked grin. &#8220;I&#8217;d just as
lief smash him here as anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter promptly pulled off his own coat
and waistcoat; then he turned up his cuffs.
Ned Chandler, his hand upon Walter&#8217;s
arm, whispered advice, his blue eyes all
the time fixed upon Barker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him,&#8221; cautioned Ned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let him get hold of you, or throw you, if
you can help it. Stand off, and hit him
back as he comes into you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both of the young fellows were fully
aware of the lawless nature of the combat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
into which Walter was about entering.
Those were rough days; and the river-men,
the pioneers, adventurers and planters who
used the great stream were rough men;
and so their ways of settling disputes
were apt to be primitive. Force was what
usually told; the man who fought the
most savage and relentless battle was almost
invariably the victor. Skill was little
considered, as is usually the case in the
outposts of the world; the man with the
bulging muscles and the flail-like arms was
the man figured on to conquer; and now as
young Jordan and Barker prepared for the
fight there were few who considered that
the former had a chance to escape being
maimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barker&#8217;s like a bull,&#8221; said an interested
river-man. &#8220;There&#8217;s no one between here
and New Orleans that&#8217;s got a chance with
him. He&#8217;ll eat this young fellow up.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the fact that the bullet-headed
young man was considered the sure winner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
made him popular with a great number of
the onlookers. That he was a noted bruiser
had been passed about, and the crowd desired
a specimen of his quality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up about it, Barker,&#8221; suggested
a planter in a huge rimmed soft hat.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that the boat will be here
only a quarter of an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A quarter of an hour!&#8221; cried another.
&#8220;Why, Barker&#8217;ll lick a half dozen like this
fellow in that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>A loud laugh went up, and the rough
throng gathered into a circle tighter than
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sail into him, Bark,&#8221; advised one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him your mettle,&#8221; encouraged
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll know better next time,&#8221; said a
third.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barker&#8217;ll break his bones like match-sticks,&#8221;
maintained a fourth.</p>

<p>One of those who stood gazing at the
preparation for battle was a tall, raw-boned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
man of almost fifty, with a good-natured
face, and a manner which was upon the
verge of the eccentric. He wore a coonskin
cap, a long fringed hunting shirt of
buckskin, leggings and tanned moccasins.
In the hollow of his arm he carried a
handsome rifle. He had been one of those
who stood upon the wharf awaiting the
tying of the &#8220;Mediterranean,&#8221; apparently
for the purpose of taking passage. But
the crowd streaming over the rail had
attracted his attention and he had followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You all seem to set a sight of store on
Barker,&#8221; said this person, after he&#8217;d listened
to the admiring remarks, and eager encouragement
given the bruiser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded a burly steamboat
man, turning to the speaker. &#8220;He&#8217;s beaten
every man along the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the hunting shirt laughed
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now,&#8221; said he. &#8220;His record&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
not quite so good as that. What you mean
is that he&#8217;s beaten all he&#8217;s fought; but that
doesn&#8217;t say much. For fellows like Barker
seldom pick a man they&#8217;re not sure of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it,&#8221; said the steamboat man, &#8220;that
you&#8217;ve seen him fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of times,&#8221; said the other, smiling.
&#8220;In fact, anybody in the habit of seeing
young Barker at all must have seen him
fight. For it&#8217;s the thing he&#8217;s usually
doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The planter with the wide-rimmed hat
surveyed the man in the hunting shirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Barker&#8217;s going to
come out on top.&#8221;</p>

<p>The backwoodsman fixed his keen eyes
on Walter, who stood with his arms folded
across his chest listening to Ned&#8217;s last words.
And then he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But if that youngster
meets him right, he&#8217;ll have no easy time
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this he worked his way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the throng until he stood at Walter&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Youngster,&#8221; said he in a low voice,
&#8220;here&#8217;s a word of advice. Use your feet.
Step around. And don&#8217;t hit him around
the face or head. You&#8217;ll only hurt your
hands, and do him no harm. Go for his
body when you get the chance. He can&#8217;t
stand such blows, and anybody who can
keep hitting him there can beat him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Except for Ned&#8217;s caution, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
him cripple you,&#8221; the words of the backwoodsman
were the last that young Jordan
heard before the battle opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;DON&#8217;T LET HIM CRIPPLE YOU&#8221;</p>


<p>He saw Barker advancing toward him,
and stepped out to meet him. The bruiser
held his arms awkwardly, his small round
head was lowered, and coming within distance
he leaped at his opponent without
any ceremony. Swish! swish! went his
short, powerful arms. Young Jordan allowed
the first to swing by him and
&#8220;ducked&#8221; under the other. Then his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
went out, catching Barker flush in the
mouth, and the right hand followed like a
flash, landing on the bruiser&#8217;s jaw.</p>



<p>However, though both had been strong
blows, sufficient to have staggered most persons,
Barker did not seem to regard them at
all, but pressed on, his arms lunging and
swinging wickedly. But both Jordan&#8217;s
hands felt the impact against the fellow&#8217;s
bony front, and as he stepped actively here
and there avoiding the other&#8217;s rushes and
watching him narrowly, this thought
formed itself in his mind:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever it was that just spoke to me
seems to know what he was talking about
as far as Barker&#8217;s head and face go.
They&#8217;re like iron. And, so, if he was right
in that, maybe he was right in the other
thing. I&#8217;ll give it a trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dozen times he had opportunities to
land blows upon Barker&#8217;s face, but he refused
to strike. The ring of onlookers seized
upon his disinclination and began to jeer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s afraid!&#8221; cried one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barker&#8217;s got him scared, so&#8217;s he dasn&#8217;t
lift a hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the backwoodsman who had spoken
to Walter smiled approvingly as he watched
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not too quick with your judgments,
gentlemen,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see something
before long. Barker&#8217;s got some one
at last who fights him in the right way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a bull, the bullet-headed bruiser
lurched after his nimbly stepping opponent.
His arms swung wildly and savagely.
Suddenly grasping an opportunity,
Walter stepped in and drove his right fist
into the other&#8217;s short ribs. Barker&#8217;s heavy
face twitched with pain, and he wavered
for an instant. Then young Jordan&#8217;s left
hand shot out and found a landing place
in the pit of the bully&#8217;s stomach.</p>

<p>That these two blows had a serious effect
was instantly evident. Barker&#8217;s face turned
a sort of sickly gray and he shook his round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
head in a fury. But he had courage; and
so once more he came on, thrashing out
with his fists more awkwardly than before.</p>

<p>Ned Chandler, never missing a move of
the two contestants, had seen the landing
of Walter&#8217;s blows with delight. But he
also saw the tremendous power in the
bully&#8217;s awkward swings, and his pleasure
was mingled with a fear that by some
chance one of them would find a mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch yourself, Walt,&#8221; he kept repeating.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get one of those in
on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Walter was careful, and he stepped
about actively and with a purpose in every
movement. Getting the bruiser into the
right position he feinted him into a mad
whirling of fists&mdash;then, one&mdash;two&mdash;the powerful
body blows were driven home once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; cried the tall backwoodsman,
much pleased, and wearing a wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s it! Keep it up, youngster.
You&#8217;ll bring him down like a coon out of a
gum tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barker flinched more under this second
pair of blows than he had under the first.
And his attack grew slacker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; cried Ned Chandler. &#8220;Now,
Walt, go in. This is your time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But keep up your guard!&#8221; cautioned
the tall backwoodsman.</p>

<p>Walter dashed at his opponent. The fists
of Barker whirled with ponderous inaccuracy;
some of the blows struck Walter,
some of them were glancing, others landed
as he was stepping away, and so lost their
power. None of them did any damage.
But the blows which he was sending in,
in return, were most effective. Sharp,
straight and all directed at the body, few
of them failed of their work. The gray of
Barker&#8217;s face increased; his knees began to
tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Barker, do something,&#8221; cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Colonel Huntley, furiously. &#8220;Are you going
to let a fellow like that beat you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your grapplers on him, Bark,&#8221; suggested
a river-man. &#8220;Get your grapplers
on him, and let&#8217;s see you twist him up like
a pipe lighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently Barker had been turning
some such idea over in his own mind, for
he at once set about putting it into play.
Evidently he saw that, for all his power
and reputation as a bully, he was no match
for young Jordan in a stand-up fight. And
so now he&#8217;d put his huge strength of body
and arm to the test.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Bark,&#8221; encouraged the
river-man. &#8220;That&#8217;s it! Work in close!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him clinch you!&#8221; cried Ned
Chandler, to his friend. &#8220;Hit him off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was Walter&#8217;s intention. He had no
desire to come to a grapple with a fighter
of Barker&#8217;s note; for in such a struggle,
no matter who gained the victory, there
would be a strong chance of severe injury.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
And that above everything else was what
he wished to avoid. So, as Barker moved
in, he was met with a shower of blows.
But the bully had learned craft; he did not
attempt to strike back, but guarded with
his arms crossed before him and with his
head held low.</p>

<p>His small eyes were glaring between his
arms and watching Walter with savage purpose.
He made a move as though to the
left; young Jordan stepped aside to avoid
him. But the thing had only been a feint,
and as Walter moved, Barker shifted suddenly
and the next instant his exultant
clutch was upon his active foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; cried Colonel Huntley. &#8220;Now
you&#8217;ve got him. Go to work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight him off, Walt!&#8221; shouted Ned,
his face paling a little at his friend&#8217;s danger.
&#8220;Fight him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ring of spectators was in a tumult.
A turning point of the battle had been
reached. Almost to a man they felt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the ruffianism of Barker would carry him
through.</p>

<p>Once he felt the band-like arms of the
bruiser close about him, Walter Jordan&#8217;s
plan of battle changed. He heard Ned&#8217;s
cry to fight the other off. But this was
impossible. He felt Barker bracing himself
for an effort, and he knew what it
meant. Once the bully had thrown him
to the ground he&#8217;d have him at his mercy;
he would not be allowed to rise until he
was helpless.</p>

<p>It required only a second or two for all
this to pass through his mind; then he
caught sight of the tall backwoodsman
over Barker&#8217;s shoulder. And that personage
made a swift and suggestive motion
with his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The elbow!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget
the elbow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the young fellow understood.
With a powerful wriggle he freed his right
arm, and drove the elbow under the chin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of Barker, pressing with all his might
against the bruiser&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; shouted Huntley, to Barker.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him do that!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was too late. The more strongly
Barker heaved and strained to throw young
Jordan, the more deadly became the thrust
of the elbow into his throat. And it was
his own efforts that were doing it. Panting,
purple of face, he realized this; to relieve
the deadly pressure he would have to
slip the grip he&#8217;d fought so hard to obtain,
and trust to luck to secure another as good.</p>

<p>His arms unlocked; breathless, he attempted
to step back for a moment&#8217;s rest
before plunging at his opponent once more.
But here he received the surprise of his
career as a Mississippi river bully. Instead
of young Jordan&#8217;s remaining upon the defensive
as he had done almost from the
start, he now leaped forward. His strong
young arms pinned the breathless and momentarily
helpless bruiser, and with a dexterous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
twist lifted him from his feet. Then
the fellow was hurled to the ground, where
he lay breathless, almost unconscious, and
absolutely defeated.</p>

<small>DAVY CROCKETT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the ring of river-men, adventurers,
planters and border characters closed in
about the prostrate form of Barker, Walter
Jordan felt a hand laid on his arm. Turning,
he saw the tall backwoodsman at his
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got all the cargo on board the
boat,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;and in a moment
they&#8217;ll blow the whistle for every one to
get back on board. There&#8217;ll be a rush;
and I reckon you&#8217;d better not be in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Chandler, who caught the words,
understood their meaning instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said he, helping Walter on
with his coat. &#8220;Barker seemed to have
quite a number of friends in that crowd.
And maybe one of them would try to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
some sort of a sneaking revenge, Walt, if he
saw a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, together with the stranger, they
walked toward the end of the wharf. And
as they stepped upon the deck of the &#8220;Mediterranean,&#8221;
her whistle shrieked a shrill
warning. There was an instant rush of passengers;
and from the upper deck the three
saw Barker helped on board by a couple of
negroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Huntley doesn&#8217;t look any too
well pleased,&#8221; said Ned with a grin, as he
caught sight of the sombre face of that gentleman.
&#8220;His little plot was rather mussed
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall backwoodsman looked interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Plot? Colonel
Huntley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The colonel,&#8221; spoke Walter, &#8220;for an
hour or two before the boat landed at Randolph
spent his time in laying the foundation
for a quarrel with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted to pick a fight,&#8221; put in Ned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
&#8220;He wanted to have Walt injured by that
blackguard Barker so&#8217;s to prevent him from
going to Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long man&#8217;s interest deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are going to Texas, are you?&#8221;
said he to young Jordan.</p>

<p>&#8220;We both are,&#8221; replied the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might I ask what part?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;San Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>The backwoodsman whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ve picked out what
seems likely to be a mighty interesting section
of the new country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the lines were cast off, and the
&#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; steamed out into the
stream; then gathering headway she once
more split the muddy waters on her journey
southward. The battle upon the pier at
Randolph was, for a time, the chief subject
of conversation. But as Barker had retired
to his stateroom, where his friends and some
of the steamboat&#8217;s people were striving to
make him presentable once more, and Walter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
held to a corner of the upper deck with
Ned and the stranger, making himself no
more conspicuous than was necessary, the
matter gradually died down, and finally almost
completely ceased to be discussed.</p>

<p>A planter, who appeared to be a man of
some consequence, appeared upon the deck
with some friends; and catching sight of
the stranger in the hunting shirt who stood
talking with the two young travelers, he
advanced with a surprised greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, colonel! Going down the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the hunting shirt smiled in
his good-natured way, and shook the planter&#8217;s
hand cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Mr. Burr,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Yes, going down the river. A little expedition,
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said the planter, addressing
those who accompanied him, &#8220;shake
hands with Colonel Crockett, the finest rifle
shot, the greatest stump speaker and the
most complete bear hunter in Tennessee.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;Colonel Crockett,&#8221; said Walter to Ned
as the backwoodsman laughingly shook
hands with Mr. Burr&#8217;s friends. &#8220;Can it be
the celebrated Davy Crockett of whom we&#8217;ve
always heard so much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it is,&#8221; said Ned, his eyes on the
colonel. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen pictures of him more
than once; and they looked just as he does
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it, Crockett,&#8221; asked Mr. Burr,
&#8220;that I find you in your old back settlement
togs, your rifle and hunting knife with you,
headed south? Surely you are not going to
Texas?&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Burr,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I surely am.
Down there&#8217;s a new country to be fought
for and freed. And down there I am going
to give what help I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested Burr, &#8220;are you going to
give up your career in Tennessee? You,
as a member of Congress, have work to
do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Crockett laughed; and there was a trace
of bitterness in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a member of Congress I <i>had</i> work to
do,&#8221; corrected he. &#8220;But, you see, that&#8217;s an
office that I no longer hold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The planter looked amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t mean to tell me you
were defeated for re&euml;lection in your district,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you just that,&#8221; said Colonel
Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d never believed it,&#8221; said Burr,
looking at his friends, wonder in his face.
&#8220;Why, colonel, you were the most popular
candidate that ever stumped Tennessee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davy Crockett smiled, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the boys set some store by me,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And they liked to hear me
talk. But politics is a queer kind of thing.
The man who gets the votes may not always
win.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Burr looked grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that is true.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The party had settled themselves in
chairs and the colonel addressed them
generally.</p>

<p>&#8220;President Andy Jackson is no friend of
mine,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I say this, mind you,
knowing that Jackson is a perfectly honest
man, a good friend to those who like him,
and a fine fighter. But he&#8217;s no friend of
mine; and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m on my way to
Texas to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jackson opposed your re&euml;lection, then,&#8221;
said one of the listeners.</p>

<p>&#8220;He opposed it early and late,&#8221; said the
backwoodsman. &#8220;He fought me as hard as
he could; and when you say that of Andy,
why, you are saying that it was a pretty
hefty battle. For he has the mettle and the
backbone of the true fighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short pause; Colonel Crockett
fingered the butt of his long rifle reminiscently
and looked across the river toward
the Arkansas shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I fought with Jackson against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the British and against the Creeks, and I
know him pretty well. But when I was a
member of the Tennessee Legislature, there
was a movement to beat John Williams for
the United States senatorship. Williams
had always done his work as well as a man
could do it; I didn&#8217;t see any reason for not
sending him back, and I said so. But they
put up Jackson. And, although I then
thought Andy the biggest man in the country,
I voted against him, and so made him
an enemy, along with his whole following.
Chickens come home to roost,&#8221; added the
backwoodsman. &#8220;They remembered it
against me, and they&#8217;ve fought me ever
since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Mr. Burr, &#8220;is this the reason
you are leaving Tennessee&mdash;because your
enemies have beaten you? Why not stay
and fight them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel cracked the joints of his
strong fingers and smiled drolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t put much into a man&#8217;s life to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
spend it fighting people who should be his
friends,&#8221; said he. &#8220;At least, that&#8217;s what I
think. And, accordingly, here I am on my
way to Texas to join Sam Houston and the
rest against Santa Anna and his crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be a strong tide set in
toward that country,&#8221; spoke another of the
party. &#8220;I hear that there&#8217;s hundreds go
down the river every week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be needed,&#8221; nodded Colonel
Crockett. &#8220;Everything looks promising
for a long war; and Texas, so I&#8217;ve heard, is
just the place where one can be carried out
to any length by men who fight and run as
the Mexicans do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talk between the men continued for
some time; it was mainly about Texas and
Crockett&#8217;s political fortunes, and the boys
listened with much interest. But finally
Burr and his friends got up, and moved
away to a place where some other people
had gathered.</p>

<p>For some little time after this the backwoodsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
sat nursing his rifle and gazing
toward the wooded Arkansas shore. Finally
he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have some kind
of a difficulty with Colonel Huntley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it would seem so,&#8221; replied Walter
Jordan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known him for a good many years,
off and on,&#8221; spoke Crockett. &#8220;Once he
owned a big plantation in Carolina and
worked a hundred slaves. Then he was
interested in a steamboat company. But I
heard some time ago that he&#8217;d lost all his
money and was, so to speak, living by his
wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That accounts for his being in the
confidence of Sam Davidge, then,&#8221; said
Ned Chandler, to his friend. &#8220;I guess
Sam has hired Huntley, and Huntley
hired Barker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that Barker would
now take it into his head to hire some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
one. Why, the thing might go on that
way and there would be no end to our
enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned joined in the laugh at this idea; but
at the same time he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the matter&#8217;s no joke,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;They mean business, and will try in
every way they know to prevent our
carrying out your father&#8217;s plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name and fame of Davy Crockett,
rifleman, bear hunter, backwoods philosopher,
had traveled at that time into every
corner of the United States. He was spoken
of at every fireside, and his homely wisdom
and basic honesty were admitted by all.
Walter Jordan knew this, and as he sat
gazing at the man, whose face was at once
droll, shrewd and fearless in expression, an
idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a man,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;who
has put himself out of his way to be my
friend. And he&#8217;s just the kind of a man
whose advice would be worth following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and whose help would be worth having
in the adventure we are now started
upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned over toward Ned, and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it would be a good
thing to tell Colonel Crockett about our
affair, and hear what he has to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; approved young Chandler at
once. &#8220;Do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Walter turned toward the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Crockett,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you
have the time to listen, and are willing,
I&#8217;d like to tell you the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett turned his shrewd eyes upon
the boy and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, youngster,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Go
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Walter related the story of
the journalist, Tom Norton; of his going
to Texas with his wife and daughter; how
both he and his wife died at San Antonio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
leaving the girl an orphan. Then came
the matter of the fortune left the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an uncle of her father&#8217;s who
willed it to her,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;He was
an odd sort of an old man, and had for his
lawyer his only other relative, one Sam
Davidge, who is known throughout Kentucky
as a double-dealer and a man who
does not stop at small things to gain his
ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him,&#8221; said Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the old man finally dropped
Davidge. My father never knew why, but
suspects he found him out in some dishonest
work. Davidge had been named as
executor to the estate; but the old gentleman
now altered this. In a sort of codicil,
my father was named as executor. When
the old gentleman died some few weeks
ago, Davidge set up a claim that he had
been influenced, that he was of weak mind
when the codicil was attached to the will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the young fellow related the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of his trip to Texas; of Davidge&#8217;s following
him, and of the appearance of Colonel
Huntley and Barker upon the scene. And
Crockett listened to it all with much attention,
nodding his head at points well made,
and putting in a helpful word here and
there.</p>

<p>When Walter had finished, the colonel
lay back in his chair in a careless, lounging
fashion and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their idea is, as you say, to reach the
girl first,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and to let them do
that would be dangerous. Of course they
may mean only to influence her; but then,
again, they may mean worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but Walter was
afraid to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>Crockett nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is <i>just</i> what I mean,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Davidge is the only other relative, you
say. Well, if the girl never appeared in
Louisville, Davidge would come into the
money.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Both boys were appalled by this; but at
length Walter said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowing the matter, Colonel Crockett,
and understanding what these men are
after, what would you advise us to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett stroked the stock of the handsome
rifle upon his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; said he, and he smiled drolly.
&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s simple enough, youngster.
Get to San Antonio first; tell the girl the
facts, and leave it to her to decide whether
she&#8217;ll go north with you and your friend
here, or with Huntley and the legal shark.
If you talk to her right and get her ear
first, I&#8217;ve got no doubt about the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Jordan smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to lay great stress on the importance
of being first,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Crockett nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; said he, his shrewd
eyes upon the boy. &#8220;There&#8217;s an old saying,
&#8216;The first blood&#8217;s half the battle!&#8217; And
it&#8217;s as true a one as was ever put into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
words. I found it out years ago in the
wilderness among the redskins and the
prowling varmints. Let them act first and
you had an almighty job getting the best
of them. But be sharp and watchful&mdash;strike
the first blow, and the rest was pretty
easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Colonel Huntley is on
board this boat; he&#8217;ll arrive at New Orleans
as quickly as we shall. There&#8217;s nothing
that I know of to hinder his pressing on
to San Antonio with as much speed as we
can make&mdash;perhaps more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; said Crockett.
&#8220;In the natural course of things he might
get better mounts than you boys, and so
cross the Injun country ahead of you.
But,&#8221; with a quizzical look in his eye,
&#8220;why let things take their natural course?
That&#8217;s what the fellow does who picks out
a shady place under a tree&mdash;he lets things
take care of themselves. But that kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
proceeding never got any wood split. Interfering
with the natural course of things
is what we call work; and work is the
thing that gets results.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Ned Chandler, &#8220;just how
shall we go to work to win, in this matter,
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not take a leaf from Huntley&#8217;s
book?&#8221; suggested Crockett. &#8220;He had the
right kind of a notion. He wanted to stop
you from getting into Texas. So why not
do the same thing for him&mdash;only in another
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Walter Jordan slapped Ned
upon the back with a force that made
that young gentleman cough. &#8220;That&#8217;s it.
We&#8217;ll carry the war into Africa, and give
Davidge, Huntley and Co. a dose of their
own medicine.&#8221;</p>

<small>BEAR HUNTING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gradually</span> it became known throughout
the &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; that the celebrated
Davy Crockett was on board, and it was
seldom, from then on, that the genial
backwoodsman was not at the center of a
knot of laughing friends, old and new, who
listened to his stories and jokes, and encouraged
him to give them more of the
same kind.</p>

<p>But, one evening, as he sat out upon the
deck with Walter Jordan and Ned Chandler
near by, the planter, Mr. Burr, induced him
to tell of one of his hunting exploits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a bear hunting story, colonel,&#8221;
suggested the planter. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long
time since I heard you tell one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;ll come a time, and it&#8217;s mighty
near at hand,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when bear stories
in this part of the world will be few enough.
The bear is going fast, and I reckon he&#8217;ll
sing his death song, in Tennessee anyhow,
in the next ten years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there were lots of them some years
ago,&#8221; encouraged Mr. Burr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaps,&#8221; said Crockett. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been into
the Tennessee wilderness where their tracks
were pretty plenty. And there was good
hunting, fresh meat to be smoked and salted
away for winter, and furry pelts to keep
out the cold of the ground when a fellow
went to sleep. Yes, there was fine hunting,
and lots of bears and panthers and deer and
fur animals beyond counting, in the woods
and along the streams.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember once,&#8221; said he, continuing,
&#8220;that I had a dream of a nigger; and when
I dreamed of a nigger that always meant&mdash;bear!
So off I sets with a couple of dogs,
my rifle and a good horn of powder and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
plenty of ball. It&#8217;d been raining all the
night before; then it had turned cold, and
the rain changed to sleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good bear weather,&#8217; says I to myself.
&#8216;I ought to get a whopper.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sleet was bad and stung my face
almost to bleeding; but I thought of the
bear that I was sure was waiting for me
somewhere, and so I held on. But I&#8217;d
tramped a half dozen miles and the only
thing the dogs turned up was a flock of
turkeys; I got a couple of big ones, and sat
down on the end of a log to rest, for the
tramp had played me out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hadn&#8217;t sat there long before I
noticed that one of the dogs, an old hound,
was acting rather excited. He was sniffing
around as though he&#8217;d got scent of
something. Then he put his nose in the
air, and let out a yowl that brought me up
with rifle ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Off starts the hounds, and me after
them. They seemed to have struck the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
trail of something and hung to it like good
fellows. A couple of times they lost the
scent, and I made up my mind each time
that the varmint, whatever it was, had
them licked; but they picked it up again
and were off once more as good as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;The woods were pretty thick,&#8221; proceeded
Crockett, &#8220;and the two old hounds
seemed to pull me through the worst of it;
and with two big gobblers on my back, I
had all I could do to keep up with them.
But suddenly there was a sort of clearing&mdash;a
natural one&mdash;and right there I saw the
biggest black bear I&#8217;d ever seen in Tennessee!</p>

<p>&#8220;The hounds stood as close to him as
they dared to go; the hair on their backs
was standing as stiff as brushes; and they
were yelping all the names at him that they
could lay their tongues to.</p>

<p>&#8220;A black bear won&#8217;t pay much attention
to hounds. But they are kind of shy of
men being around&mdash;especially men with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
rifles in their hands. It may be that the
daddy of all the bears has handed it down
that a man with a rifle is a thing to be
afraid of. Anyway, when this black fellow
got sight of me, he turns to and breaks for
a thicket which was close by. In after him
went the hounds; and after the hounds
went I. It was as dense a growth, that
thicket, as any I&#8217;d ever seen, and I had to
squirm through it; also it was hard to see
far through the growth, and so I had to
trust to the dogs to tell me when the bear
was close at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tight work,&#8221; observed Mr. Burr.</p>

<p>&#8220;It just was,&#8221; replied Colonel Crockett.
&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t long before I heard a noise
ahead; and there was the bear climbing an
oak tree. When he reached a good heavy
branch he stopped, got out on it and turned.
Then he began to look around for me. And
now I had a chance to get another look at
him, and still I felt he was the biggest bear
I&#8217;d ever seen in those woods. If I&#8217;d had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
scale along and could have induced him to
get on them I&#8217;ll venture the critter&#8217;d
weighed an easy six hundred pounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was less than a hundred yards from
him, and to make sure of my shot I reprimed
my gun. Then I drew a bead on
him and fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get him?&#8221; asked Ned Chandler,
who had been listening intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not then. The bullet must have hit
him somewhere, though, for he gave a kind
of a yawp; but he looked none the worse,
and went on sticking to the limb of the oak.
So I rammed home another charge of
powder and ball, primed as carefully as I
could, and let him have it again. This
time the shot counted. He fell out of the
tree with a yell, his big paws going like
mad, and his red mouth wide open. One
of the hounds forgot his training and
rushed in on him, thinking he was a goner.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that black fellow had lots of fight
in him still. He scooped the hound up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
as a squirrel scoops up a nut; and he
hugged him tight. The hound yowled
something scandalous; and his comrade
barked fit to split. As they were down on
the ground through this part of the affair I
couldn&#8217;t see much of them because of the
denseness of the thicket. But, thinking I
was about to lose a pretty fair kind of a
hound, I dropped my rifle, drew my knife
and tomahawk, and with one in one hand,
and one in the other, I broke my way
toward the place of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there wasn&#8217;t much left to the
hound by that time,&#8221; said Burr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. He&#8217;d lots of life in him, for
he yelled like a whole pack. You see the
bear hadn&#8217;t got a proper pressure on him,
and he was just shifting his grip when I
busts through the thicket. And no sooner
had I showed my nose than Mr. Bear
seemed to understand that he&#8217;d been blaming
his misfortunes on the wrong party.
Right away he knew it wasn&#8217;t the hound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that had tumbled him out of the tree, but
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, quick as a wink, he dropped
the dog, and gave his attention to me.
Now the knife I had in my left hand was a
good enough knife, as such things go; and
the hatchet was a fair kind of a weapon.
But when I looked at them and then at that
six hundred pounds of bear, they looked
foolish; and so back I went, with all the
speed I could get up, to the place where I
had dropped my rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I picked it up, and saw, or rather
heard, the bear coming for me; and as I
was about to lift the piece to my shoulder,
to wait for him, it struck me that it wasn&#8217;t
loaded. I&#8217;ve done some quick pouring of
powder in my time, but I think that was
the quickest I ever undertook. I pulled
the stopper from my powder horn and let
the charge run into the barrel of that old
rifle without paying much attention to how
much, then I rammed it home, and the bullet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
too, and then primed as carefully as I
could under the circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Along came the black bear, wounded,
growling and as mad as tarnation. And up
went the rifle, and I fired. Down went the
critter on his side; he gave a couple of
kicks and was dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite an experience,&#8221; said Mr. Burr.
&#8220;Suppose you had, in your hurry, loaded
your rifle improperly and it had missed fire.
What would you have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; said Crockett, promptly; &#8220;run as
fast as my legs could carry me. A wounded
bear is no kind of a beast to stand and
reason with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do with him after you
got him?&#8221; asked Ned Chandler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as he was all of six hundred
pounds, I couldn&#8217;t do much myself. So I
got back to my cabin as quick as I could,
got some friends and some horses, and we
started out to find the carcass. I&#8217;d blazed
the way with my tomahawk, and we hadn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
much trouble in coming to the place. Then
we dressed the critter, loaded the meat on
the horses&#8217; backs and took it home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The genial hunter told many quaint and
stirring tales of his experiences in the Indian
wars, in the deep forests of the southwest,
and of the wild and dangerous animals
with which those forests were overrun. The
lawless character who is always to be found
on the outskirts of civilization also came
into his conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever you go in the southwest
country, you run across him,&#8221; said Colonel
Crockett. &#8220;He&#8217;s to be found in every
settlement, in every camp, traveling every
trail. He&#8217;s always armed, he&#8217;s usually got
courage, he never fails to cause trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met that sort of fellow myself,&#8221;
nodded the planter, Burr. &#8220;He&#8217;s to be
avoided.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Crockett shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The fact that
people give him the width of the trail in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
passing is one of the things that encourages
him to go even further than he&#8217;d gone before.
That kind of a fellow should always
be shown his proper place. He should be
opposed when he makes a move to interfere
with the rights of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there was a clatter of chairs on
the deck and looking around Walter Jordan
saw Huntley and a sharp-faced man
dressed in black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Ned Chandler in a low
tone to Walter, &#8220;there&#8217;s Sam Davidge now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s seen that it&#8217;s no use hiding any
longer,&#8221; said Walter; &#8220;and now he&#8217;s come
out in the open. But,&#8221; his eyes on the two
men, &#8220;I wonder what they&#8217;re up to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No good, I&#8217;ll say that,&#8221; said Ned, with
a promptness that made Walter smile.</p>

<p>The two men made way for themselves
among the chairs; and when they had
reached the party of which Crockett and
the boys were members, they paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Mr. Burr?&#8221; cried Huntley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
with great cordiality. &#8220;I thought I
saw you on board to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, sir?&#8221; said Burr, who
did not seem at all sure who Huntley was.
&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met you&mdash;in Nashville, I think it
was. Abe Sterrit, I think, introduced us,&#8221;
said Huntley, seeing that Burr was not
certain of him.</p>

<p>The planter&#8217;s face fell; and Crockett
chuckled at the sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abe Sterrit&#8217;s a horse jockey at Nashville,&#8221;
whispered the backwoodsman to
Ned, a wide grin upon his face. &#8220;And
I don&#8217;t think Mr. Burr sets much store
by him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, yes,&#8221; said the planter to Huntley,
&#8220;I think I remember you. I trust
you&#8217;ve been well, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tolerable,&#8221; said Huntley. Then, looking
at Crockett, &#8220;How are you, colonel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening,&#8221; replied the backwoodsman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen you since you were electioneering
for your second term in Congress,&#8221;
said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve run across you,
either,&#8221; said Crockett, evenly. &#8220;But I
remember seeing you then, well enough.
You were making speeches right and left
against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Huntley laughed loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, colonel,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s these
little differences of opinion that make life
worth living. I did work against you,
that&#8217;s a fact, but because I was of opposite
beliefs, and not through any sort of ill
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett smiled drolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it your own way,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Huntley seemed especially earnest; he
took a step nearer to the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always felt a strong regard for
your type of man, Colonel Crockett,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve always had a strong regard
for your work and aims. And,&#8221; here he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
cast a swift glance in the direction of the
boys, &#8220;I mean to prove that to you, right
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter nudged Ned with his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it coming,&#8221; whispered Ned in return.
&#8220;It&#8217;s something about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett, with the droll smile still upon
his face, replied to Huntley:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a sight obliged for your interest,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s come to my ears,&#8221; said Huntley,
&#8220;that you are going to Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the plain truth,&#8221; replied
Crockett. &#8220;But what is there against
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered the man, hastily.
&#8220;That is, nothing against that in itself.
But I understand, colonel, that you mean
to accompany these two young men to San
Antonio upon a certain mission&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; cried Colonel Crockett.</p>

<p>He looked in amazement at the speaker
and then at the two boys.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve heard of it,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>But Huntley disregarded the statement,
evidently not believing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take this occasion to warn you,&#8221; he
went on, &#8220;that you are being deceived.
The errand of these two young men to San
Antonio is not at all the sort of thing they
claim. As a matter of fact, it&#8217;s just the reverse.
They are engaged in a piece of obvious
rascality, and it is only right that
you should know it before you get into it
too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the sharp-faced man in the black
clothes stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Davidge, Colonel Crockett,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Samuel Davidge; and I&#8217;m a
councilor at law, in Louisville. It is possible
that you have heard of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the backwoodsman, and
there was a world of significance in his
look and tone, &#8220;I have heard of you&mdash;often!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>His meaning was so plain that some in
the party laughed outright. Davidge swallowed
once or twice; but he was a man
hardened to affront and he went on without
a change of tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a conspiracy in progress, and
these two boys are participators in it.
They have, no doubt, told you some cock-and-bull
story as to why they are going to
Texas. But, believe me, sir, they are deceiving
you. If you will give me a few
moments I will inform you as to the true
facts, and let you know in plain words&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here he was interrupted by Davy
Crockett suddenly arising to his feet, sending
his chair tipping over with an angry
kick as he did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Davidge,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Before you go any further in this talk of
yours I want to say this to you, and,&#8221; his
eyes going to Huntley, &#8220;to you also.
These two boys have struck me as being
of good mettle. They stick to what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
set out to do, and they are willing to fight
for what they believe is right. I&#8217;ve got
the whole story from them of why they are
going to Texas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pack of lies!&#8221; cried Huntley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, Colonel Crockett,&#8221; warned
Davidge. &#8220;Take care. They are sharp,
young as they are. They&#8217;ll lead you into
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Crockett, and he turned a
quaint smile upon Walter and Ned, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been in trouble before now, and I guess I
can take care of myself, and get out of it
again, if they get me in. As to their being
sharpers and telling me a pack of lies, I
take leave to doubt it. But they <i>have</i> told
me of your little scheme, Mr. Davidge,&#8221;
nodding to the sharp-faced man, &#8220;and of
how you crept on board this boat in secret
pursuit of them. And of you, Huntley,&#8221; to
the burly man, &#8220;and your hiring a bruiser
to injure one of them and so prevent him
from finishing his journey. And I <i>do</i> believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that, for it&#8217;s about the kind of thing
you&#8217;d both be likely to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; cried Davidge, with dignity, &#8220;you
are insulting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; spoke Huntley, his face
turning a deep red as he strove to control
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; went on Crockett, &#8220;there has been
no understanding between these youngsters
and myself about going to San Antonio
with them. That little bit of steamboat
gossip, if you really heard such, is not true.
However,&#8221; and the droll smile came into
his face once more, and he nodded his head
shrewdly, &#8220;now that the thing&#8217;s been suggested
to me, it wouldn&#8217;t be a half bad idea.
I&#8217;ve got lots of time on my hands, and the
freedom of Texas can wait a bit longer. I
<i>will</i> go to San Antonio de Bexer with these
youngsters, and I&#8217;d like to see any man,
black, white or red, lay another straw in
their way!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>SURPRISING NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">David Crockett</span>, as is well known, was
a man of eccentric manner and character;
and eccentric people are given to whims
and caprices. And it was one of these latter
which gave Walter Jordan and Ned
Chandler most invaluable aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean it, Colonel Crockett?&#8221;
asked Ned, after Huntley and Davidge had
gone away, and the deck party was breaking
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; answered the backwoodsman, in
his downright way. &#8220;If I&#8217;ll not be a hindrance
to you, and can help in any way,
count on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needless to say the boys warmly assured
him that he&#8217;d be of the greatest help to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;With you to post us on what to do,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Walter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have no trouble at all in the
new country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had no
experience there myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve been in places that were
pretty similar,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;It&#8217;ll not be
new to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were in high feather all the way
down the river; any fear they might have
had of Huntley and his friends left them;
with so noted a fighting man as Davy
Crockett as a companion, they felt that they
were safe from the attempts of even the
most hardy.</p>

<p>Huntley and his comrades seemed also to
feel something of this; the lads now rarely
saw them on deck; they kept themselves
close, and did nothing to interfere with the
young travelers, neither in look, word, nor
act.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, somehow,&#8221; observed Ned Chandler,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t think that they&#8217;ve forgotten us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Walter. &#8220;They
are keeping us in mind, right enough. Only
from now on they are going to be less open
in what they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steadily upon her course down the broad,
yellow Mississippi steamed the &#8220;Mediterranean.&#8221;
She stopped at many places to
take on or put off cargo or passengers; and
Crockett, so it seemed, was constantly meeting
old friends and making speeches to gatherings
which came together to cheer him at
wharves and landing places. The whole
country, so it seemed as they got further
south, was aflame at the idea of Texas and
Mexico engaging in a conflict. And that
such a popular and picturesque personage
as Crockett should be on his way to take
part in the struggle greatly added to the
excitement.</p>

<p>Everything proceeded without any stirring events,
except those noted, until the
boat drew in at the mouth of the White
River and Crockett encountered an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
friend and fellow keeper of the border,
Captain William Cumby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; said Cumby, as he shook the
backwoodsman&#8217;s hand, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen
you in years; and I&#8217;m &#8217;tarnal glad of the
chance to do it now, old boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They conversed for some little time and
Crockett introduced his young friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;All going to Texas, eh?&#8221; said Cumby,
after he had favored each of the lads with a
hand-shake which was like the grip of a
vise. &#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s entertainment you&#8217;re
looking for, you&#8217;ll find it in plenty,
youngsters. A friend of mine just came
up from there and he tells me things are
biling to such a degree that they&#8217;ve got
considerable trouble keeping the lid on the
pot half the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>A small, elderly man with a parchment
face and many deep wrinkles was tying a
pair of horses to a fence some little distance
away. Captain Cumby called to
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;Here, Dolph,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I want you
to shake hands with Davy Crockett.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolph looked interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not <i>the</i> Davy Crockett?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;That very same gentleman,&#8221; answered
Captain Cumby.</p>

<p>Dolph approached and gripped Crockett&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you.
I&#8217;ve heard of you for years and ain&#8217;t never
had the pleasure of setting eyes on you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolph,&#8221; said Cumby, after he&#8217;d introduced
the boys to the old man, &#8220;they are
all on their way to Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolph shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Texas,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived
there for fifteen years, off and on; and it&#8217;s
a fine country. But it&#8217;s pizen just now;
and unless you&#8217;re going there for a special
purpose, such as helping to fight old Santa
Anna, or such, I&#8217;d advise you to keep
away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Captain Cumby laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolph don&#8217;t believe in strangers going
into Texas without being warned,&#8221; laughed
Captain Cumby. &#8220;But he&#8217;s going back
himself in a day or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s to be expected,&#8221; stated
the old man, who evidently was hardy
and had many years of border experience.
&#8220;And I belong down there. And when
the fighting starts once more I want to be
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How comes it,&#8221; asked Crockett, &#8220;that
you left just when things was a-shaping
themselves for the big smash-up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to,&#8221; replied Dolph. &#8220;Just plumb
had to. It all come of me being in the
party that went with Colonel Milan to
attack San Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you were with that lot!&#8221; said
Crockett.</p>

<p>Dolph nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I never want to see a worse
organized gathering of white men,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
he. &#8220;They&#8217;d come together from all parts
of Texas and the southwest, thinking that
war was to start at once. The lot of them
moved toward San Antonio, and were then
halted. As we didn&#8217;t attack, they got disgusted,
and the whole crowd was just melting
away. Burleson was at the head of
the force, and one night he made up his
mind to retreat. This almost brought on a
mutiny among those who were left. And
so then Colonel Milan goes to Burleson
and asks permission to call for volunteers
to attack the town. And Burleson
gave it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the colonel jumped out in front
of the crowd of men, who were just biling
with vexation, and waves his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who&#8217;ll go with old Ben Milan into
San Antonio?&#8217; shouts he.</p>

<p>&#8220;And in a minute the lot of them were
around him and shouting like mad. Well,
we attacked the town, and after a long fight
from street to street, and house to house, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
beat the greasers. But right in the middle
of it whom should I run across but an
American girl, who was living with a
Spanish family in one of the houses which
we broke into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American girl!&#8221; Walter Jordan
gazed at the speaker eagerly, and then
turned his glance upon Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was she?&#8221; asked the latter of
Dolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;She hadn&#8217;t an American friend nearer
than New Orleans,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;I
found that out next day. We didn&#8217;t know
what to do with her; but after putting our
heads together, the officers made up their
minds to send her with a family party
which was headed northeast, and they sent
me as guide. I left her a month ago,
safe and sound, with friends at New
Orleans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was her name?&#8221; insisted Ned
Chandler.</p>

<p>Dolph looked puzzled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;It was Ethel,&#8221; said he, scratching his
head. &#8220;But consarn me if I can think of
the other name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Norton,&#8221; suggested Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; said Dolph. Then, in
surprise: &#8220;But how&#8217;d you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Davy Crockett.</p>

<p>Walter halted in the answer he was about
to make.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look around,&#8221; said Crockett.
&#8220;But I see that sneaking fellow Davidge
watching us from the upper deck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The place where the little party stood
upon the wharf was in the great shadow
cast by the &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; as she lay at
her moorings; and by a sly glance upward,
Ned Chandler saw the black-clad, sharp-faced
lawyer leaning over the rail of the
boat, and evidently doing his best to hear
what was being said.</p>

<p>At once, though with an assumption of
carelessness, they walked up the wharf, and
when out of hearing and also out of sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
behind some bales of cotton, they began to
question the old Texan.</p>

<p>In a few moments they were convinced of
the welcome fact that Ethel Norton, the
girl whom they were going to San Antonio
to seek, was in New Orleans.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks,&#8221; said Ned Chandler, to Walter,
&#8220;that all we&#8217;ve got to do now is to keep on
board the boat until she reaches New Orleans.
It&#8217;s turned out no kind of a job at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad will be delighted,&#8221; said Walter.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have her in Louisville on the next
up-river boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry your horses,&#8221; said Colonel
Crockett, who seemed to be turning the situation
over in his mind. &#8220;If you do,
you&#8217;ll wear them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys looked at him quickly, for there
was something in his voice which caught
their attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing that&#8217;s sure,&#8221; said the
backwoodsman, &#8220;and that is that Davidge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and Huntley will keep you youngsters in
view until they see you have set out for San
Antonio. If you stick to the &#8216;Mediterranean&#8217;
all the way down the river, they
will too. At New Orleans they&#8217;ll follow
you; they&#8217;ll find out that the girl is there.
And so you&#8217;ll lose all the advantage which
Dolph&#8217;s information has given you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The point of this argument was plain to
both boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think we&#8217;d best do?&#8221;
asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; said the backwoodsman.
&#8220;Let me carry it out for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads agreed eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Colonel Crockett,
smiling in his droll way. Then to Captain
Cumby and the old Texan, &#8220;Wait here a
bit for us. We&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the two boys he started toward the
&#8220;Mediterranean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he in a low tone as they
went, &#8220;you are to order out your baggage as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
coolly as you please. Try and make it look
as though you&#8217;d intended leaving the boat
at this place from the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the boat, the boys
did as directed; they had their belongings
in the clumsy traveling bags of that period,
and they got them out on deck and down
the gangplank&mdash;Crockett doing the same.
When they reached the place where Captain
Cumby and Dolph awaited them, Crockett
said humorously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cumby, you ain&#8217;t got no kind of
knowledge of what&#8217;s going on yet. But
keep a stiff upper lip, and just do what
you&#8217;re told, and we&#8217;ll post you by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking around the edge of the cotton
bales, Ned Chandler saw the hurrying forms
of Huntley and Davidge and Barker, baggage
in hand, hurrying down the plank
from the steamboat. Reporting this to
Crockett, the latter laughed as one well
pleased, and then said to the old Texan:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolph, see if you can get us some kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
of a trap for ourselves and our belongings.
Captain Cumby, if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; to that
astonished gentleman, &#8220;we&#8217;ll pay a little
visit to your plantation, and if you treat us
well, we may stay there for a couple of
days.&#8221;</p>

<small>A LITTLE JOKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Texan secured a conveyance, and
Crockett and the two boys, with their baggage,
tumbled in. Captain Cumby and
Dolph mounted their horses, and away they
went along the dirt road that led from the
river. The last sight they had of Davidge
and his friends, they were standing upon the
wharf eagerly questioning some negroes and
pointing after the wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll know where we&#8217;re going,&#8221; said
Ned to Crockett.</p>

<p>The backwoodsman nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they will, youngster,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s what I calculate on their
doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once at the huge farm, or plantation of
Captain Cumby, that genial gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
made them feel at home; and then, after a
splendid dinner in which game and fish
from the streams formed a part, Crockett
took both Cumby and Dolph aside and
plunged at once into a long, low-voiced
conversation.</p>

<p>The two boys sitting comfortably in the
two big cane chairs heard a series of
chuckles and guffaws from the three.</p>

<p>&#8220;The colonel&#8217;s got some sort of a joke on
foot,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s about this matter of ours,&#8221; said
Walter. &#8220;He&#8217;s hiding it from us, because
I can see he wants to make it a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night as the host, Crockett and the
two boys were sitting quietly together in the
captain&#8217;s big living-room, the young fellows
listening to the stories of the veterans, Dolph
entered, a broad smile upon his wrinkled,
tanned face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, colonel,&#8221; said he, to Crockett,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a cute one. They did just what
you said they&#8217;d do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Captain Cumby gave a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Were you talking
to them, Dolph?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolph nodded, still grinning gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to instructions,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
just took to hanging around a fence corner.
And by and by a stranger comes up the
road&mdash;one of the men I see leave the
steamboat in such a hurry. And he gets
me in conversation about the country. I
told him I thought Arkansas was a great
place, but that I was going to take the
trail back to Texas to-morrow at sundown.
He perked up at that and got almighty
interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Back to Texas?&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s a mighty long journey to take
alone,&#8217; says he, cunningly enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It would be if I was going alone,&#8217;
says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; says he, &#8216;somebody&#8217;s going along
with you.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Three of them,&#8217; says I. &#8216;We&#8217;re off for
San Antonio to-morrow night.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How are you going?&#8217; asks he, very
innocent like.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, horseback to the Red River. Then
down that on a boat to Natchitoches. Then
horseback across Texas.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett was vastly amused at this repetition
of the conversation between Dolph
and the man at the fence corner; both he
and Captain Cumby laughed and slapped
their knees. And now, for the first time,
the boys got a glimpse of the backwoodsman&#8217;s
intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I see what you mean to do,&#8221;
said Ned Chandler, eagerly. &#8220;You intend
throwing them off the scent by letting them
think we are going on to Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;ll be on their way there, while
we are steaming down toward New Orleans,&#8221;
put in Walter, well pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the size of it,&#8221; said Colonel
Crockett. &#8220;But to succeed we can&#8217;t let it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
rest as it lies. We must do something further;
for they are pretty cute and not of
the sort that fly off on a thing without
feeling as sure as they can that it&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>But just what further step he meant to
take the colonel didn&#8217;t say; apparently he
enjoyed the suspense and excitement of the
boys as much as he did the joke on Huntley
and his companions.</p>

<p>Next day the boys spent in riding over
the country with Crockett and Captain
Cumby and interviewing a number of
gentlemen who were interested in recruiting
men and forwarding war material down
the Red River to be used in the Texans&#8217;
war with Mexico. They arrived at Cumby&#8217;s
plantation once more in about the middle
of the afternoon; after supper they sat and
talked of the doings of the day, and the
prospects of success for Texas. Then Dolph
entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole lot of them&#8217;s snooping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
around and waiting,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
they&#8217;ve got their horses down the trail
a piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Dolph,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
might as well get our mounts ready.
And then we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a half hour there came a clatter of
hoofs outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, youngsters,&#8221; said Crockett, &#8220;just
do what I do; and say what I say, and ask
no questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>They followed him outdoors. He had
his long rifle across his back; his knife and
hatchet were in his belt. The boys were
attired, at Crockett&#8217;s request, as though for
a long journey.</p>

<p>Dolph sat astride a tall horse and held
three others by the bridles. Crockett
climbed into the saddle of one and the
boys mounted the others. Slowly they
rode down the path to the trail, Captain
Cumby walking at the side of Crockett.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
And when they reached the trail they drew
rein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cumby,&#8221; said Davy Crockett, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bid you good-bye.&#8221; He spoke in a loud
voice and leaned over in his saddle and
shook the captain&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Texas is a
long way off and war is mighty uncertain,
so I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll meet again or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, colonel,&#8221; said Cumby, &#8220;take
care of yourself. Do all you can for Texas,
but don&#8217;t forget to keep an eye out for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Captain Cumby,&#8221; said Walter
Jordan, also shaking their host by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, youngster,&#8221; returned the captain,
genially. &#8220;And you, too, boy,&#8221; to
Ned. &#8220;Good luck to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, with a call from Dolph to the
captain, and a chorus of good-byes from
all, they shook their reins and set off
along the westward trail. A mile from
the Cumby place Crockett said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>They all drew up; the backwoodsman
got down from his nag, and, stooping, laid
his ear to the trail. Then he remounted
once more, and the boys heard him laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I heard
them pounding along at a good smart pace.&#8221;</p>

<p>For at least two miles further they kept
to the trail, their horses going at an easy
lope. Then at a word from Crockett they
left it, and drew up in the deep shadows of
a thick grove. Fifteen minutes later three
horsemen appeared, their nags going at a
sharp trot, and their voices lifted in conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll probably hold to this trail till
they get to Hamlin,&#8221; said the voice of
Huntley. &#8220;We&#8217;ll leave it and strike
straight across country and so beat them to
the river. If we can get a boat ahead of
them we might get into San Antonio three
days in advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davidge was replying to this when the
distance became too great for the listeners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to hear. Fainter and fainter grew the hoof
beats on the soft trail, and finally they died
away altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Davy Crockett, and the
boys noted a pleased chuckle in his voice,
&#8220;now that we&#8217;ve seen them well on their
way, youngsters, suppose we mount once
more and ride back to Captain Cumby&#8217;s.
He&#8217;ll be expecting us.&#8221;</p>

<small>TEXAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a few days after this little hoax
practiced on the sharpers by Colonel Crockett
that the steamboat &#8220;General Morgan&#8221;
tied up at the wharf and Walter Jordan
and Ned Chandler got on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8217;ll get you into New Orleans in a
little while,&#8221; said the genial backwoodsman
as he shook hands with them. &#8220;And like
as not you&#8217;ll get your business over and be
on your way home before I leave this section.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay a while, then,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cumby tells me it&#8217;ll be to my advantage,&#8221;
said Crockett. &#8220;They are raising
money to put a regiment into the Texan
service, and he thinks I ought to join it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Ned, &#8220;as we come up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
river we&#8217;ll stop off and see if you&#8217;re still
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Crockett, and he shook
hands with them again. &#8220;Do that, sure.
And I&#8217;ll be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the &#8220;General Morgan&#8221; steamed
out into the river, they saw him waving his
coonskin cap to them; and they stood at
the rail as long as they could see the wharf,
replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that,&#8221; said Ned, putting his hat
firmly upon his head, &#8220;is one of the finest
men I ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;He&#8217;d
do anything to serve any one he took a
fancy to, or any one in need of help.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;General Morgan&#8221; was one of the
swiftest steamers on the river; and it was
not a great while before the boys found
themselves in the city of New Orleans.
Here the war rumors from Texas were
thicker than further up the river. The
recruiting of volunteers was openly going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
on. Upon posts and dead walls were loud
sounding placards calling for volunteers.
All this interested the boys greatly; but
they were naturally still more interested in
the finding of Ethel Norton.</p>

<p>The address given them by Dolph was
not at all difficult to locate. But when
they reached it and talked to the people
who lived there they received some shattering
intelligence.</p>

<p>The girl had gone back to San Antonio!</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked Walter, amazed.
&#8220;Why should she go back there at such a
time? Texas is expected to be in a blaze
of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said the woman to whom
they spoke. &#8220;And she knew it. But
she saw a newspaper, from Louisville, I
think, and it had something in it about a
relative dying and leaving her some money.
She was afraid she couldn&#8217;t establish her
identity without some papers which she&#8217;d
left behind at San Antonio.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said Ned Chandler, &#8220;she didn&#8217;t
go alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;My two sons
went with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little questioning showed that the
girl&#8217;s party had gone almost a week before;
they had a wagon and a number of saddle
horses; the woman had been told the way
they&#8217;d take, but she had forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Walter, a short time afterward
when the two had talked the matter
over from all sides, &#8220;the best thing I can
think of is to go back up the river, if we
can get a boat, and go down into Texas
with Colonel Crockett.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Ned Chandler, his blue
eyes snapping with pleasure. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
to get down there after all. For a
while I thought we&#8217;d be cheated out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Walter reasoned the matter out,
while they&#8217;d probably reach San Antonio
after the rival party of Sam Davidge, those
gentlemen would be so far ahead that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
would work against them rather than in
their favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get into the town before Miss
Norton gets back there,&#8221; said the boy to
Ned. &#8220;And they&#8217;ll be told that she left
with Dolph months ago. Then they&#8217;ll
head for New Orleans, and so miss her
altogether. If Colonel Crockett&#8217;s ready to
start soon, we&#8217;ll reach Texas not much, if
any, behind a party that&#8217;s traveling overland
with a wagon. They&#8217;ll have the
trails to contend with all the way; also
they&#8217;ll have to go slow and save their
horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>They inquired about boats; and to their
gratification there was one that very evening.
They boarded her, counting themselves
in great luck. She was the &#8220;Arkansas
City,&#8221; a strong, bustling little craft,
which steamed against the dark waters of
the Mississippi with much valor.</p>

<p>Reaching Montgomery&#8217;s Point again,
they went ashore. Once more luck was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
with them. Crockett was still at the
Cumby plantation, but upon the eve of
starting for Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;tarnal glad to see you,&#8221; said the
backwoodsman, heartily, as he clasped
their hands, &#8220;and I&#8217;m also sorry about
what&#8217;s happened. But if the girl&#8217;s gone to
Texas&mdash;all right. We&#8217;ll find her there, if
it can be done any way at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the two boys had been traveling
up and down the Mississippi upon their
hunt for Ethel Norton, Colonel Crockett
had been working industriously. A great
sum of money had been subscribed by
numerous southern gentlemen to what was
known as the &#8220;Crockett Fund.&#8221; This was
to be devoted to the liberation of Texas.</p>

<p>The backwoods orator had made good his
reputation; his speeches for the Texan cause
had drawn great throngs of people; his
words had a wide appeal, and people to
whom the cry of the new country for aid
had been faint and far away now heard it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
plainly for the first time. So, in consequence
of all this, Crockett had grown
much in reputation and influence.</p>

<p>Crockett had arranged to travel into
Texas with a small party which was then
ready for the journey. The recruiting was
to go on, and the parties of volunteers were
to be sent after them into the new country
as they were armed and equipped.</p>

<p>As Walter and Ned saw a long journey
ahead of them through a dangerous region,
they set about preparing themselves for it.
First they purchased, with the aid of
Dolph, a couple of saddle horses of that
small, tough breed common to the southwest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those ponies,&#8221; said the old Texan, valuing
the purchases with an expert eye, &#8220;will
give you good service and are worth all
you&#8217;ve paid for them. They are of the
kind that without much corn will stand
hard riding and still not be any the worse
for it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Next the lads bought themselves a rifle
each. Both knew the use of the weapon,
having hunted in the Kentucky mountains
and woods many times. Also they purchased
good, heavy, broad-bladed hunting
knives and a couple of small hatchets, such
as are used by woodsmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget a derringer each,&#8221;
said Colonel Crockett. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small thing,
has very little weight, and can be carried in
the pocket without trouble. It&#8217;s a weapon
that&#8217;s saved more lives at time of sudden
danger than any other I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, with their derringers, hunting
knives, hatchets and rifles, the two young
fellows felt themselves very well armed indeed.
Mounted upon their ponies, attired
in fringed hunting shirts and broad
brimmed hats, they looked very well fitted
to cope with both the savage region and
savage men ahead of them.</p>

<p>It was early one morning that the word
was given; and off they started across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Arkansas to Fulton, where they were to
get the steamboat. The state of Arkansas
was at that time very well settled; its hospitable
people never failed to do what they
could for the travelers on their way to the
war; good food and good beds were to be
had without trouble. At Fulton, which
they made without any mishap, they
boarded a boat which was to take them
down the Red River as far as Natchitoches.</p>

<p>This latter proved to be a small place on
the south bank of the river; the party
spent one night in the town, and then set
off toward the Texan town of Nacogdoches,
which lay a hundred and twenty miles
away over the old Spanish trail.</p>

<p>This latter lay through a wild country in
which ranged great herds of buffalo, and
droves of small, active mustangs, wild for
many generations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tough little critters,&#8221; said old Dolph as
he rode with the boys in advance of the
party. &#8220;You never felt such hard mouths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
in your lives. Don&#8217;t care no more for a bit
than if it was of soft rubber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they are caught, then, and broken!&#8221;
said Ned, looking at the hardy little fellows
as they tore away over the prairies like the
wind, their tails flying like banners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of Mexicans and some Americans
make a business of it,&#8221; replied old Dolph.
&#8220;Them two you boys are riding now once
raced, wild, on these very plains.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took three days between Natchitoches
and Nacogdoches; they camped by the side
of the old trail at places where they could
get water; the air was bracing, the game
they shot during the day was dressed,
cooked and eaten, and the lads enjoyed
every moment of the time.</p>

<p>About sundown upon the third day they
sighted Nacogdoches and were warmly
greeted by the people of the town. Nacogdoches
lay a day&#8217;s ride west of the Sabine
River. At that time it had a population
of about a thousand people; but as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
was a trading place and a stopping point
for the flow of northern emigration into
Texas, there was usually two or three times
that number upon its streets. There was an
old French fort, built more than a hundred
years before to guard against the attacks of
the Indians.</p>

<p>But there were now Indians a-plenty in
the town. All the tribes for many miles
into the wilderness came there to trade, and
on the evening of the arrival of the party
under Davy Crockett there were scores of
them to be seen in the streets. Their nodding
eagle feathers, their fringed buckskin
leggings and beaded moccasins, their quivers
of arrows and their long bows and sheathed
knives gave them a wild and savage look.
There were also many Mexicans in Nacogdoches,
and their picturesque costumes,
huge, jingling spurs, great sombreros, and
viciously careening horses, contrasted
strongly with the red or blue shirts of the
American adventurers, their long boots, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
modern equipment of arms and horse gear.
Also there were a number of men in the
backwoods garb of Crockett and the boys.
These stood in quiet places, as a rule, leaning
on their long rifles and looking bewildered
at the bustle all around them, so
different from the solitude of their native
forests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a lively sort of a town,&#8221; said
Crockett, after they had put up their mounts
at the tavern and were about to go in to supper.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t expect to see anything quite
so stirring, Dolph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not see another for some time
again,&#8221; said the old Texan. &#8220;This country
is not given to towns of any size, though
I dare say we&#8217;ll grow some as we go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had a good supper, a good night&#8217;s
rest and an excellent breakfast at Nacogdoches;
and then they took horse and
started upon the long journey toward the
San Antonio River and the seat of war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it easy, youngsters,&#8221; said old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Dolph. &#8220;Don&#8217;t wear out yourselves or
your ponies. You have a good bit of
prairie to cross, and it&#8217;s not to be done in a
hurry if you hope to keep yourselves in condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>At high noon the party stopped at a
hurrying little stream that moved through
a grove of tall trees. Here they rested and
ate and drank. Away in the distance,
across the level plains, could be seen a herd
of grazing buffalo; and Crockett watched
them, reclining upon his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been no such critters as
them in Tennessee for many a year,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like pretty well to have a
shot or two at them before we leave this
country behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Walter and Ned eagerly assented to
this. The mighty bison appealed to them
as a worthy subject for the chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a try at them now,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>But Crockett smiled in his droll fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so easy as you seem to think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
youngster,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It won&#8217;t do to mount
horse and ride out after game like that.
They know what a horseman is, and they
know what a rifle means when it speaks.
And they are as shy as antelope, for all
their size. You&#8217;ve got to get to windward
of them or they&#8217;ll scent you; and once they
do that they are off like sixty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett had no sooner uttered the last
words than there came a queer shrilling
sound such as neither of the boys had ever
heard before, followed by a sudden shock
of one body striking against another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indians!&#8221; cried Davy Crockett as he
threw himself flat upon the ground, his rifle
in his hands, his keen eyes searching the
green of the noonday prairie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Ned Chandler, as he and
Walter crouched low.</p>

<p>Walter looked in the direction indicated
by his friend&#8217;s pointing finger. There,
quivering in the trunk of a tree, was a long
Indian arrow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what it was,&#8221; said young
Jordan, drawing in his breath sharply.
&#8220;Look, Ned, it&#8217;s sunk an inch into the
wood. It&#8217;s good the red rascal made a bad
shot of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down all,&#8221; warned old Dolph. &#8220;There&#8217;s
quite a party of them; and they have rifles
as well as bows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think they are, Dolph?&#8221;
asked Crockett, coolly, looking to his rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comanches,&#8221; replied the Texan. &#8220;I
can tell by their head-dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a rattle of rifle shots and a
cloud of arrows; and the boys saw a line of
savage horsemen lift out of the long dry
grass and come dashing toward the grove.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>ATTACKED BY COMANCHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were four men in the party in the
grove beside Crockett and Dolph. The two
lads made up eight in all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your fire,&#8221; cautioned Davy
Crockett. &#8220;Don&#8217;t waste any of it, boys;
because we&#8217;ve got our work cut out for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were at least twoscore of the
savages dashing down upon the grove upon
the backs of their hardy mustangs. Crockett
had no idea of the marksmanship of his
companions. Eight rifles in the hands of
men who knew how to use them would
work deadly havoc among the oncoming
Indians; but if it should prove that the men
were not skilled with the weapon, things
would not be so well.</p>

<p>But the backwoodsman set his teeth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be long before I know,&#8221; said
he, grimly.</p>

<p>He threw forward his rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The other weapons went forward; eight
black muzzles peered out at the oncoming
savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; said Crockett.</p>

<p>The rifles spoke sharply; down in their
tracks went several of the mustangs; and
several others went dashing riderless across
the prairie. Shrill yells went up from the
Comanches; their ponies, startled at the
sudden blaze of fire from ahead, and the
fall of their fellows, reared, bucked, and
tried to bolt off to one side. The Comanches
fought with their mounts and at
last headed them around, together, in the
proper direction. But by this time the
whites had reloaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; ordered Colonel Crockett, once
more.</p>

<p>Again the rifles cracked; and down went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
more horses and riders in a plunging heap,
while the savage band, unable to face the
deadly tubes which threw death into their
faces, turned and bounded away over the
grassy plain beyond range of the white
men&#8217;s fire.</p>

<p>Crockett rammed a fresh charge home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good shooting,&#8221; said he, approvingly.
&#8220;One way or another, boys, we&#8217;ve accounted
for a full dozen of the red rapscallions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Texan, together with the others,
was also charging his piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not done yet, colonel,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;The Comanche is a fighting Injun, and it
takes a good bit to make him change his
mind, once he&#8217;s taken to the war-path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear nothing &#8217;bout them being
at war with the whites,&#8221; remarked one of
the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more did I,&#8221; said Dolph. &#8220;But,
then, you can never tell. They are always
rising. Let some rascal of a white man
cheat a Comanche at a trading place and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
that Injun goes and tells his friends. Like
as not, a small war follows, until they think
they&#8217;ve got satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that might be what this is,&#8221; said
Crockett, his eyes upon the party of savages
which had come to a halt about a half
mile out upon the prairie and were listening,
apparently, to the eloquence of a chief.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got an idea of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the Texan.</p>

<p>&#8220;These redskins had some of their people
in Nacogdoches last night and they were
watching for some small party that was to
leave the town. We happened to be that
party. It&#8217;s my idea they have taken a leaf
from the white man&#8217;s book, and are nothing
more or less than robbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Dolph nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of them
doing things like that before now. But,
whatever they&#8217;re after, they mean to give
it another try.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke the Texan pointed out across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the prairie. The Comanches had remounted
and were riding forward in an open fashion,
their bows and rifles held ready for use.
But at some distance from the grove they
halted; dismounting, they made their
ponies lie down. Then stretched at full
length behind this living breastwork, they
leveled their guns, and fitted arrows to
their bows.</p>

<p>From behind trees and logs, the white men
watched the preparations of the savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a kind of a cute little dodge,&#8221;
spoke Crockett. &#8220;I never see an Injun do
it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Dolph nodded and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a favorite trick with the Comanche
and the Apache. These Injuns of the
plain are &#8216;horse&#8217; Injuns; and they&#8217;re
different in their ways from the redskins
you meet with in the wooded countries
and the mountains. They spend most of
their time catching and breaking ponies
and learning tricks in riding. There are
some fine horsemen on these southwestern
plains; but the finest of all are the Comanches.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE COMANCHES HAD REMOUNTED</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Here the rifles of the Indians spoke. But,
if they were excellent horsemen, as the
Texan said, they were not good marksmen,
for their bullets went wide. Their arrows,
however, flew true, and many a feathered
shaft struck with a deadly thud into the
trunk of a tree behind which stood one of
the whites.</p>

<p>A man near Crockett fired, rather excitedly,
in return, and the bullet did no more
than knock up the dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care of your powder,&#8221; said Crockett,
from behind his tree, but never shifting his
eyes from the dry grass where the savages
lay behind their horses. &#8220;Don&#8217;t waste a
single charge. Take good aim; and don&#8217;t
fire until you see the whites of some one&#8217;s
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an interval of inaction; the
savages were apparently reloading.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;When they have loaded,&#8221; said old Dolph,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll take a peep around their ponies to
see what things look like over this way.
So watch for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t fire unless you are sure of
your Injun,&#8221; said Crockett, who knew there
was only a limited supply of powder in the
party; and as there was no knowing how
long the attack would continue, he wished
to be as sparing as possible.</p>

<p>Sure enough, as the old Texan had said,
when the Comanches had finished loading
they showed a desire to know the exact position
of their intended victims. A tufted
head appeared around the side of a mustang.
Dolph&#8217;s rifle cracked like a whip; there
was a yell of pain and then silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got him,&#8221; said the old Texan, and he
calmly reloaded his rifle.</p>

<p>Again came the flight of arrows and the
reports of the Comanche rifles; but as before,
the shafts and bullets did no harm.
Crockett fired when he saw the plumes of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
savage show above the back of a horse. It
so chanced that the speeding bullet struck
the mustang; it leaped up, forgetting its
training; its rider was now exposed to the
fire of the whites. Three rifles cracked;
and the Comanche threw up his arms and
sank back.</p>

<p>Seeing the deadly nature of the white
men&#8217;s marksmanship, the savages grew wary.
Only now and then an arrow flew; occasionally
a bullet lodged in the ground or in
a tree trunk.</p>

<p>An hour passed in this way. It was now
almost three o&#8217;clock; and Davy Crockett as
he crouched behind his tree grew both weary
and restless.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are cunning varmints,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and they are holding off until nightfall.
Under cover of darkness they&#8217;ll creep up on
us and beat us down by weight of numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darkness will favor them,&#8221; spoke old
Dolph. &#8220;And if we are here when it falls,
we are goners.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Crockett, in his dry way,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we can get away with
thirty pairs of eyes watching us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Walter Jordan spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Crockett,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have an
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t see the Comanches as they lie
behind their mustangs,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;But
suppose I climbed one of these trees. I
could have a good sight of them then, and
could drive them off with a couple of shots,
maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett smiled and twisted his good-humored
mouth drolly to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very good plan, youngster,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But it has one big drawback.
How are you going to get up the tree? The
redskins would tumble you over before you&#8217;d
get half-way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the disappointed look upon the
boy&#8217;s face, and added:</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were hard pressed and had to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
something on the jump, it would be a thing
we could try. But, as it stands, I think I&#8217;ll
make a little experiment that&#8217;ll be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning his head he glanced toward
the tree which concealed the old Texan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolph, who do you reckon&#8217;s the best
shot in the lot of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; replied the veteran, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s next?&#8221; asked Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to say I am,&#8221; spoke Dolph,
humorously. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t, and stick close
to the truth. Jed Curley&#8217;s the best shot
here after yourself, colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jed Curley was a young adventurer of
about twenty-five with whom both Walter
and Ned had become very friendly. He
was a powerfully built fellow, and his clear
eyes and steady nerves gave him the working
basis of a sharp-shooter.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Crockett. &#8220;Just where
are you located, Jed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here, colonel,&#8221; came the voice of
the young man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;All right. Lie low, but listen to what
I&#8217;m going to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to fire at that pinto Injun
pony,&#8221; said Crockett. &#8220;Not to kill it,
though; I&#8217;ll be careful of that. You see,
that pony jumping up a while ago gave me
a notion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it, colonel,&#8221; came the voice of
Jed. &#8220;You scare up the mustang, that
leaves the Injun uncovered, and before he
can get shelter, I draw a bead on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; answered Crockett. &#8220;Ready,
Jed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; then
Crockett&#8217;s rifle rang out. One of the ponies
leaped up with a snort; Jed Curley&#8217;s piece
cracked instantly and the red rascal behind
it lay silent in the grass.</p>

<p>Quickly the two men reloaded; again
Crockett fired; once more a wounded
mustang uncovered its master; a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
time the sharp-shooter&#8217;s rifle spoke, and the
master lay as silent as the other.</p>

<p>Within twenty minutes this performance
had been gone through three times; then a
panic seemed to strike the savages; they
leaped up, urged their horses to their feet,
mounted and turned to flee.</p>

<p>&#8220;A volley, boys!&#8221; yelled Crockett.
&#8220;Take good aim.&#8221;</p>

<p>The volley pealed from the six rifles that
were still loaded, and four more of the
Comanches fell. Then the remainder of
the band, with startled yells, went flying
toward the east.</p>

<small>THE BUFFALO HUNT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rapidly</span> reloading, the little party of
whites stood upon the verge of the grove
and watched the band of redskins race
away across the plains.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the looks of things,&#8221; said old
Dolph, &#8220;I&#8217;d say they&#8217;ll not be back this
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett shook his head and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;those Comanche gentlemen
are completely scared. That was a
trick they&#8217;d not thought about; and as
they hadn&#8217;t time to work it out, they
thought, very like, it was some kind of
&#8216;bad medicine.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>However, they made up their minds
not to trust to appearances; and mounting
their horses they rode away toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the southwest, going at a long, slow
lope.</p>

<p>Night fell, and still they continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best to put all the distance between
ourselves and that party of reds that we
can,&#8221; said Crockett. &#8220;They&#8217;re the kind of
varmints you can never count on to do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they went into camp an hour or
so after dark, they lighted no fires, but ate
food that required no cooking.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes hard chewing,&#8221; grumbled old
Dolph. &#8220;But then it can&#8217;t be helped.
Better a tough bite of grub than an Injun
arrow that&#8217;d make me bite the dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night was cool, but they made beds
of grass, wrapped themselves in their
blankets, and with their saddles for pillows,
they slept soundly. For the first time since
they started from the Mississippi River,
however, they had a guard for the camp,
Jed Curley, Ned Chandler and old Dolph
taking turns until sunrise and breakfast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>They pushed on rapidly that day, keeping
a sharp lookout for the savages. But
none came in sight; and so, to rest their
ponies, which had been severely tried, they
halted a good two hours before sundown
and went into camp upon the banks of a
small creek whose margin was thick with
trees.</p>

<p>Walter Jordan and Ned Chandler had, during
the day, tried their marksmanship upon
some flocks of prairie chickens; and though
these were difficult game to bring down
with a rifle, they had bagged a couple of
brace. The chickens were now stripped of
their feathers and dressed; each was skewered
with a ramrod, and put to roast over
the red coals. Flour was mixed and baked
into flap-jacks; and so they ate a meal
such as was enjoyed by the riders of the
plains.</p>

<p>A guard was kept that night, also; but
there were no signs of Comanches, and they
slept undisturbed. After breakfast next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
morning they mounted once more and
started upon their journey.</p>

<p>It was a splendid country which they now
crossed, not so level as that of the previous
day&#8217;s journey, but rich in promise of the
yield to the farmer in the days to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wonderful range for grazing live
stock,&#8221; said Crockett, his observant eye
taking in all the details and possibilities of
the region. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be grass in long
seasons, and there&#8217;s plenty of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Dolph agreed with this.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best grazing country in the
southwest,&#8221; said he. &#8220;To prove that just
notice the herds of buffalo and wild
mustangs that roam through this country.
They know the places where the good grass
grows.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence for some little time,
and then Ned Chandler said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a good deal about buffalo
hunting, and I&#8217;d like to have a try at it before
we reach San Antonio.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;So should I,&#8221; spoke Jed Curley. &#8220;It
seems as though it would be fine sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Davy Crockett, &#8220;as I&#8217;ve
said, I shouldn&#8217;t despise the chance myself,
boys. It&#8217;s been many a year since I&#8217;ve had
a run after a herd of buffalo, and if we sight
any, we&#8217;ll take half a day off our journey
and have a shot at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>This filled both Ned and Walter with
enthusiasm; and all day they looked forward
eagerly to the possibility of sport.
But they were disappointed; the sun was
getting low, and they were casting about for
a camping ground when suddenly old Dolph
was heard to call out to Crockett:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Look there!&#8221;</p>

<p>All turned and they saw him pointing to
the ground some little distance away. It
was near the brink of a spring that oozed
from the ground in a sort of hollow; and
all about it were the marks of trampling
hoofs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buffalo!&#8221; said Colonel Crockett.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>The entire party gathered about the spring
and examined the tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were only about half a dozen,&#8221;
said the old Texan, as his sharp eyes followed
out the hoof prints. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a
herd near by. These were only stragglers,
come to look for water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Supper was cooked and eaten that evening
amid considerable excitement; and as
they lay wrapped in their blankets afterward,
the boys listened to the stories told
by Crockett and old Dolph of mighty buffalo
hunters who had gone before and of hunts
that had come to be parts of the history of
the west. Story after story followed, the
other men taking part, telling of their own
experiences in chase of the mighty beast of
the plains, or those of others whom they
had known. Both youngsters dropped off
to sleep with the voices still coming out of
the shadows around the camp-fire; and little
wonder that they dreamed of great herds
of buffalo whose hoof beats were like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
thunder, and whose mighty rush seemed
to shake the earth.</p>

<p>At sunup all were astir, and breakfast
was quickly over; then they looked at their
arms and ammunition, and climbed upon
their horses&#8217; backs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Crockett, to the two
young fellows who rode beside him, &#8220;as you
never rode the buffalo range before, it&#8217;s just
as well that you know something about the
matter. Above all, look out for the buffalo
bull; you&#8217;ve heard of the grizzly bear and
the panther and other dangerous beasts, and
they are dangerous enough, to be sure. But
the buffalo bull, especially when he&#8217;s
wounded, is one of the worst brutes that a
man ever faced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, when you draw a bead on one,&#8221; said
old Dolph, who rode near by, &#8220;be sure and
aim at a place that&#8217;ll make the shot fatal.
If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll have a job on your
hands that&#8217;ll be hard to finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tracks of the buffalo they&#8217;d been following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
finally merged into a wide, much
trampled trail, evidently made by hundreds
of the animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I thought,&#8221; said the old Texan,
in a satisfied tone. &#8220;They belonged to a
big herd, and now have joined the rest of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along the broad, trampled track of the
buffalo rode the hunters, their eyes ahead to
catch the first glimpse of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some ponies don&#8217;t like the smell of
buffalo,&#8221; said Dolph; &#8220;and they are hard
to get up to a herd. Others again don&#8217;t
care anything about them and are likely to
run you into danger if you don&#8217;t look out.
The best kind of a horse is the kind that
understands what you are about&mdash;that the
thing&#8217;s a hunt&mdash;that there&#8217;s a time for getting
in close, and a time for getting away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;they must be
trained to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly, yes,&#8221; said Dolph. &#8220;But not
always. Some mustangs take to the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
naturally. This one that I&#8217;m riding is one
of that kind. He knows all about buffalo.
But it may be that none of the others know
anything. So give one eye to the game and
the other to your pony.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was about noon that they sighted the
herd; far off on the plains the great shaggy
beasts were grazing on the dry grass, scattered
over a great extent of country. The
hunters halted at the first glimpse of them,
and held a consultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind is dead from the west,&#8221; said
Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be well if some of us stayed here,&#8221;
said old Dolph, &#8220;and if some others rode
around to the east, and others to the north.
Then at a signal&mdash;say a rifle shot&mdash;we could
all ride down on them from three directions
and scatter them all over the prairie.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was considered a good idea. So
Dolph and two of the men were left at the
halting place and the other five pushed
around to the east. Here Jed Curley and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
one other man were left; Crockett and the
two boys held on until they reached a point
south of the grazing buffalo.</p>

<p>The great animals were slowly moving
about upon the range, never suspecting that
their hunters were so close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; asked Colonel Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; answered the boys in a
breath.</p>

<p>They rode forward at a sharp gallop.
Crockett&#8217;s rifle rang out in signal to the
others waiting to the north and east; and
the shot also served to bring down a cow
which stood near. Startled at the shot, the
great heads lifted and the bulls stared
about for a sight of the enemy. Then the
rifles of the boys spoke and another of the
beasts fell.</p>

<p>The air was filled with bellowings; away
toward the north moved the herd. But in
a few moments the reports of rifles from
that point turned them toward the south
and east. Jed Curley and his companion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
were now heard from; and as their rifles
were discharged, the buffalo halted in a
panic. For a moment there was a pause;
then helter skelter they went in every direction
over the plains, their tails up and
their heads down.</p>

<p>The hunters had all reloaded their pieces
and they now dashed in among the scattered
herd, each selecting his particular
quarry. The pony which Walter Jordan
rode was a hard-mouthed little beast, with
a temper all its own. He fancied he&#8217;d have
some trouble with it if it proved to be one
of those mounts which Dolph said didn&#8217;t
like the smell of buffalo.</p>

<p>But it was the contrary. The mustang
seemed to enter into the spirit of the chase
with such excellent good will that the boy
was delighted. He passed several cows and
yearling bulls; but held his fire for bigger
game. His eyes traveling over the racing
buffalo had lighted upon a huge bull, a
monstrous black fellow with a huge head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
and the shoulders and hump of a giant of
his kind.</p>

<p>Fired with ambition and encouraged by
the willingness of his horse, Walter dashed
toward the black bull. When within fifteen
yards he dropped the reins, steadied
his pony with his knees and raised his long
rifle. Clear and sharp the report rang out;
the great bull stopped in his tracks, threw
up his huge black head and bellowed with
rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch that fellow!&#8221; yelled Jed Curley
as he dashed away in pursuit of another
bull. &#8220;He&#8217;s only wounded!&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter remembered what old Dolph had
said regarding wounded bulls, and wheeled
his horse away. Rapidly he began recharging
his rifle; his eyes went from this operation
to the wounded bull; for the moment
he forgot his horse entirely. Suddenly the
mustang went to his knees; he had planted
a forefoot in a prairie-dog&#8217;s hole, and Walter,
unable to stop himself, went flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
over his head, his rifle dropping from his
hands.</p>

<p>Like a cat, the mustang scrambled to its
feet and darted away; and the boy stood
dismounted and weaponless, facing the great
black bull.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>A FIGHT WITH MEXICANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bull which faced Walter Jordan was
apparently the monarch of the herd. He
had wicked little eyes which were now red
with rage and the pain of his wound. His
hoofs tore at the sod, his jaws champed,
and a rumbling bellow sounded deep in his
throat. Before him was his foe. Somehow
this creature which stood before him had
wounded him. And now he was going to
be revenged!</p>

<p>Lowering his giant head the bull charged
at Walter; the boy stood his ground until
the animal was almost upon him; then he
sprang aside, and the great bulk of the maddened
brute tore by him like a tornado.</p>

<p>Then Walter leaped to the place where
his rifle had fallen. The charge of powder
and ball had been rammed home; the piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
only required priming, and the boy was
hurriedly attending to this very necessary
thing when the black bull wheeled, sighted
him, and charged once more. But this time
the beast was more cunning. Apparently
he had profited by the one fruitless charge;
he seemed to have weighed the situation
and planned to overcome it.</p>

<p>The charge was slow; the head was not
held so low; the little angry eyes were fixed
upon the boy. This time Walter knew he
could not wait until the last moment and
then leap aside out of danger. The bull
meant to trample him under his sharp
hoofs and gore him to death. But for all
he realized this, his hands were steady as
they worked at the priming of his rifle.
The seconds passed and he realized, with a
cold feeling at his heart, that the piece
would not be ready to fire before the monster
was upon him. His breath stopped, as
though to meet the shock. Then he heard
a voice cry out:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;Steady, boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like the crack of a whip a rifle rang
out; the black bull halted; the great head
drooped; then a shudder ran through its
mighty frame, and it toppled over on its
side&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call that a close shave,&#8221; came the voice
of Crockett. &#8220;Another moment, youngster,
and you&#8217;d have been under his feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dazed, and with a sense of everything
being a very long distance away, Walter
turned and saw Colonel Crockett and old
Dolph ride up. Crockett slipped from his
horse and began to reload his gun, while
the old Texan sat admiring the huge beast
which had fallen before the backwoodsman&#8217;s
aim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Colonel Crockett,&#8221; said the young
fellow, as his wits slowly came back to
him, and he realized what had happened,
&#8220;I have you to thank for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett drove home the charge of
powder, and smiled in his usual droll way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;I have <i>you</i> to thank,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for
giving me a shot at the finest bull I ever
saw. What do you think, Dolph?&#8221;</p>

<p>The wrinkled veteran shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a mighty beast,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There are not many like him on these
prairies, if any.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a half hour the herd of buffalo had so
scattered over the plain that the hunters
had brought down a dozen or so in all;
and as the ponies were tired by the sharp
work, and they had no desire uselessly to
slaughter the bison, they halted in the pursuit
and returned to the place where their
leader had been left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Crockett, &#8220;we&#8217;ve had a
very good little hunt of it while it lasted.
And now if we&#8217;re going to have any of the
meat, we&#8217;d better set about it and then be
on our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They cut sufficient tender meat from the
carcass of a yearling which old Dolph had
been careful to shoot for just that purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and with this carefully packed, they resumed
their journey toward the southwest.</p>

<p>The day&#8217;s ride was filled with &#8220;buffalo&#8221;
talk; and the camp-fire that night saw a
roasting of juicy strips of the yearling&#8217;s
meat and a fervent wishing that the party
might fall in with such royal sport at least
once more before they had reached their
journey&#8217;s end.</p>

<p>Next day they crossed the Brazos; and
a few days further the Colorado came in
sight. As they caught the sheen of its
waters under the afternoon sun, they also
caught the glint of something harder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold steel,&#8221; said Crockett, shading his
eyes with both hands, and looking keenly
ahead.</p>

<p>A party of almost a score of horsemen
were advancing, the sun striking their rifle
barrels. But it was the glitter of the points
of long lances they carried that had attracted
the attention of the band under
Crockett.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Mexicans,&#8221; said old Dolph as he took
a long look at the party. &#8220;No one else
carries a spear, except the Comanche; and
these ain&#8217;t redskins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Colonel Crockett, and he
turned his eyes from the oncoming horsemen
to the country round about, &#8220;I
reckon the Mexicans, as a class, ain&#8217;t any
too well disposed toward Americans. So
we might just as well pick out a place to
meet them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some little distance to the left was a sort
of knoll, heavily wooded and overlooking
the river; this seemed a likely sort of place
for a stand against an enemy, so Crockett
gave the order, the mustangs were headed
toward the knoll, and the Americans took
their station upon it.</p>

<p>As they were ascending its side, the
Mexicans saw them for the first time, and
halted. Then a half dozen of them rode
forward to have a closer look at the northerners;
having gained a knowledge of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
scanty numbers, the Mexicans uttered loud
cries of triumph, shook their weapons at the
party upon the knoll, and then rode back
to their friends.</p>

<p>Crockett ordered his men dismounted;
the mustangs were placed among the trees
and fastened by the bridles. Then with
ready rifles the little band faced the opposing
riders of the plains.</p>

<p>With a sudden fan-like movement the
Mexicans spread out in a sort of half circle
and dashed at the rising ground upon which
the Americans had taken their station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; said Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; came the order.</p>

<p>The deadly rifles spoke; a half dozen of
the Mexicans went down in the dust.</p>

<p>Swiftly the long weapons were reloaded.
Once more they were leveled and again they
flashed out their messages of death. This
time the Mexicans halted in their rush;
half their company lay upon the ground.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
With one accord they tugged at their bridles,
whirled their active little horses around,
and bolted off across the plains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; cried Walter Jordan, as he rose
up and gazed after the flying horsemen.
&#8220;Look there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a boy,&#8221; shouted Ned Chandler, &#8220;and
he&#8217;s tied to one of the ponies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An American, too,&#8221; said old Dolph, as
he drove home the ball into the barrel of
his rifle.</p>

<p>In the rear of the Mexicans raced a pony
which bore upon its back, evidently tightly
bound to the saddle, an American boy of
about sixteen years.</p>

<p>&#8220;A prisoner,&#8221; said Jed Curley, throwing
forward his deadly rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, Jed,&#8221; warned Crockett.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t kill or cripple the mustang so that
it&#8217;ll fall! The boy might be hurt; for tied
up as he is, he can&#8217;t help himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jed&#8217;s rifle sounded; but apparently he
missed, for the pony continued.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;I was <i>too</i> careful,&#8221; said Jed. &#8220;You try,
colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crockett threw his long rifle to his
shoulder; its report was answered by a leap
from the running horse; the animal went
painfully on for some little distance upon
three legs; then it slowed down and finally
stopped altogether.</p>

<p>At this the Americans mounted in haste
and rode across the prairie to the place
where the wounded pony stood, with the
boy, trussed and helpless, upon his back.</p>

<p>Jed Curley cut the bonds with his hunting
knife. The young fellow slipped from
the back of the horse and sat upon the
ground rubbing the circulation back into
his arms and legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had these ropes so tight,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that I could hardly breathe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about sixteen years of age, a
bright-looking lad with, apparently, plenty
of spirit and good sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name, sonny?&#8221; inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
old Dolph, as he sat on his horse looking down
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sid Hutchinson,&#8221; answered the boy.
&#8220;And I thank you, gentlemen, for saving
me from the Mexicans.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party dismounted and Walter and
Ned helped young Hutchinson rub back his
circulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they come to get you?&#8221; asked
Davy Crockett. &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From New Orleans,&#8221; answered the boy.
&#8220;I was crossing Texas to San Antonio with
a wagon, my brother, and a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Walter and Ned paused in their operations;
they gazed at the boy and then at
each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl?&#8221; demanded Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was her name?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethel Norton,&#8221; replied Sam Hutchinson.
&#8220;And I haven&#8217;t even the smallest idea where
she or my brother is now.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE PLOTTERS ONCE MORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment after the statement by Sid
Hutchinson, the two boys and Crockett
looked at each other in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the colonel, finally, &#8220;it&#8217;s
like finding a needle in a haystack, boys;
but we&#8217;ve found it&mdash;all by chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few words Walter had told young
Hutchinson the necessary facts of his hunt
for Ethel Norton; and Sid looked amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, look at that!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Did
you ever hear anything like it before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell us what&#8217;s happened,&#8221; urged
Ned Chandler. &#8220;How did the Mexicans
come to get you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy got upon his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had about as nice and quiet a
journey as you&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Nothing happened until yesterday, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
we crossed the Colorado and went into
camp. Then we met three Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three!&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the other boy. &#8220;They
were, strangely enough, coming from San
Antonio, and were on their way to New
Orleans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Ned and Crockett and Walter exchanged
glances. The eyes of the backwoodsman
were full of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said he. &#8220;And of course
you all got to talking and saying how queer
it was that you were going <i>from</i> New Orleans
<i>to</i> San Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; admitted the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the three Americans seem interested?&#8221;
asked the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;They did,&#8221; said Sid Hutchinson.
&#8220;That is, for a while. Then they seemed
to shut up tight; and they didn&#8217;t say
much more about anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they give any names?&#8221; asked
Walter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;One&#8217;s name was Huntley&mdash;I think they
called him colonel. Then there was a
sharp looking man in black&mdash;Davidge
they called him. I forget the name of the
third one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Davy Crockett, &#8220;what
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought they meant to camp with
us that night,&#8221; said Sid. &#8220;But they
changed their minds and went away a
little after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When were you attacked by the Mexicans?&#8221;
asked Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning. We&#8217;d just broken
camp and had got the mules hitched to
the wagon, when they came down on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of Miss Norton?&#8221; asked
Ned, feverishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last I saw of her,&#8221; said Sid, &#8220;she
was on a mustang, tearing away toward the
southwest with my brother Bill beside her.
Then I was cut off, and headed for the
river, meaning to swim my pony across.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
I&#8217;d got to this side, but the Mexicans knew
the country and in a little while had me
surrounded. Then they took me back
across the river and began following the
trail of those of their band who&#8217;d rode after
Ethel Norton and my brother Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Walter and Ned in a
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d gone about six or eight miles,&#8221;
said the boy, &#8220;and then we heard firing
ahead; some of the Mexicans went forward
to find out what it meant; they came back
in a little while full tilt and away we struck
back for the river once more. We&#8217;d crossed
and had ridden about an hour on this side
when we sighted you folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any idea what the firing
meant that you heard when the party
stopped and turned back?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sid shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But if my
judgment&#8217;s any good, I&#8217;d say that the lot
that had gone in chase of Ethel and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
brother had been given a good stiff run, and
in the end had fallen in with some Americans
who&#8217;d sailed into them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;Miss Norton
would be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sid nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way to make sure,&#8221;
said Davy Crockett. &#8220;And that&#8217;s to cross
the river and find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pony which Sid Hutchinson had
been bound upon was not fit to ride; but
there were a number of riderless mustangs
standing and trotting about on the plain, belonging
to Mexicans who had fallen in the
fight. One of these was caught without
trouble, and Sid mounted at once.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour they reached a
ford of the Colorado and crossed; Sid led
them to the site of the encampment where
the Mexicans had first attacked them; and
at once Crockett and Dolph caught the trail
of the pursuers of Ethel Norton and Sid&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
brother Bill, and away they rode, the remainder
of the party following with ready
rifles. After a hard ride they came to a
place which was thickly grown with timber.</p>

<p>Sid Hutchinson called to Crockett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where we stopped when we heard
the firing,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It was somewhere on
the other side of the timber.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party pushed their way through the
trees; and in a little while they came upon
the scene of what must have been a hard
fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;And once more the Mexicans got the
worst of it,&#8221; said Jed Curley.</p>

<p>Dead men and horses lay about; but of
living men there was no trace. Dolph rode
about the field and narrowly scanned the
field for indications.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the way the Mexicans went when
they left,&#8221; said he, pointing to the ground.
&#8220;And here&#8217;s the direction the people took
who fought them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Walter and Ned examined the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
trail eagerly; both had the same thought in
his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wagon tracks,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;Here
they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Ned excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethel and Bill&#8217;s gone off with the party
that rescued them,&#8221; spoke young Hutchinson.</p>

<p>&#8220;And toward San Antonio,&#8221; said Davy
Crockett.</p>

<p>The little band followed the trail for a
few miles and then went into camp. Early
in the morning they were off once more.
But the party ahead of them were evidently
hard riders, for the distance between them
did not seem to decrease.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my private opinion,&#8221; said Colonel
Crockett, &#8220;that this trail is a half dozen
hours old. More than likely the folks
ahead have ridden a good part of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the afternoon they crossed the Guadalupe
River and pushed toward San Antonio
de Bexer. They did not reach the town until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
long after nightfall; and then Crockett
rode directly to the headquarters of Colonel
Travis, where he was warmly welcomed.</p>

<p>Travis was a stalwart young man who had
gone into Texas much as Crockett himself
had done; and he shook hands with the two
boys cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Every
state in the Union seems to be sending men
and boys to help the cause along. In a
little while we shall have an army large
enough for work against Santa Anna. And
then we can begin active operations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were then introduced to &#8220;Jim&#8221;
Bowie, known throughout the southwest as
the first user of the celebrated &#8220;Bowie
knife.&#8221; He was a big light-haired man,
with the blue eyes of the fighter, and had
crossed the prairies from Louisiana, where
he had his home, to take part in the coming
struggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s hardly a day,&#8221; said he, after he
had greeted the party with rare good will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
&#8220;that I don&#8217;t meet a few newcomers. To-day
it&#8217;s Colonel Crockett and his friends;
yesterday it was an American girl and boy
who were racing across the plains near the
Colorado with a crew of Mexicans after them
full tilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Ned and Walter grasped Colonel
Bowie&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl!&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she now?&#8221; demanded Walter.</p>

<p>Bowie looked from one to the other of the
boys in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s just now with Mrs. Allison, and,
I reckon, sound asleep,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s the boy in the next room there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sid Hutchinson leaped through the door
and into the adjoining room with a whoop.
A young fellow of about nineteen sat reading
an old newspaper in a corner; and in a
moment he and Sid had their arms about
each other and were prancing about the
room like mad. When the first great rush
of joy was over, Sid introduced his brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to Walter and Ned who had followed him
into the room, and in a few words explained
the facts of his capture and rescue and of
Walter and Ned&#8217;s search for Ethel Norton.</p>

<p>Bill Hutchinson listened in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, at length, &#8220;it does beat
all how things come about, doesn&#8217;t it?
Ethel will be glad to see you.&#8221; Then turning
to his brother he added, &#8220;Do you remember
those three men who rode up to our
camp the other night and then rode away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Sid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what would you say if I told you
I saw them among the Mexicans who chased
me and Ethel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d believe it,&#8221; said Sid, quietly and
promptly. And then he told his brother
who the three were, and the nature of their
errand to Texas. Bill listened, amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Hello! What&#8217;s
this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are rogues,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;And
as Sam Davidge is to come into the estate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
in case Ethel Norton does not claim it,
there&#8217;s no telling what they would do,
should she fall into their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good sense,&#8221; remarked Bill
Hutchinson. &#8220;And I say the same. Well,
I guess Ethel&#8217;s all right now, though.
She&#8217;s with Mrs. Allison, and <i>she</i> is an American
woman of the right kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does Mrs. Allison live?&#8221; asked
Ned Chandler.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of town which you must
have entered,&#8221; replied Bill. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small
&#8217;dobe house with a garden about it. It
stands all alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Walter and Ned remembered the
house, for they had passed by its very door.
There had been a light burning in one of
the windows and they had remarked how
lonely it looked, as they rode toward it over
the trail. And now, when they learned
that the girl they had come so far to see was
there, and recalled the loneliness of the
place, they looked at each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; suggested Walter, &#8220;we go
over that far and take a look at things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned was willing and eager, and the two
Hutchinsons showed an interested willingness.</p>

<p>As the boys passed through the room
where Crockett sat with Travis and Bowie
and some others, they, in a low voice, told
him where they were going.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather late,&#8221; said the backwoodsman.
&#8220;And like as not they&#8217;ll all be abed.
But,&#8221; with a nod of the head, &#8220;it never
does any harm to have a look around.&#8221;</p>

<p>San Antonio was one of the oldest Spanish
settlements in Texas. The site was first
occupied in 1715 as a military post to protect
the region from the French, then occupying
Louisiana, and also to guard the
Franciscan friars whose missions, planted
along the San Antonio River, were liable to
attack from the Indians.</p>

<p>It was an important town, having a population
of about twenty-five hundred, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
was a celebrated trading place for the Indians
and the Mexicans of the northern
provinces.</p>

<p>Under the Franciscans, a great number
of Indians had been taught the laws of
civilization and religion; great irrigation
ditches had been cut to water the soil; fine
stone buildings and churches had been
erected. But during the period of American
filibustering expeditions, and the revolution
during which the Mexicans threw off
the rule of Spain, the town had been left
practically unprotected; the attacks of the
fierce people of the plains, the Comanches
and Apaches, had been frequent; and so
the churches and stone buildings were now
ruins, the great ditches choked and useless,
the civilized Indians had disappeared.</p>

<p>So it was a very much decayed San
Antonio through which the four boys
passed on their way to Mrs. Allison&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>The moon was shining, and the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
&#8217;dobe building stood silent and pale under
its cold light. As the boys stood some
little distance away, they heard the whinny
of a horse and the stamp of hoofs. But
they did not attribute any importance to
this; horses were to be heard and seen anywhere
in towns like San Antonio. But
when they saw two indistinct forms holding
close to the shadows thrown by the
house, they became all attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it quietly now,&#8221; warned Walter
Jordan. &#8220;It might mean nothing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon their hands and knees they approached
the house; or at least three of
them did, for Sid Hutchinson had noiselessly
left them, walked softly along the
deserted street for a space, and was now
speeding as hard as he could go for the
American headquarters.</p>

<p>Walter and Ned had left their rifles
behind them, but each possessed a derringer
which Crockett had advised them to buy at
the beginning of the journey west from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Mississippi. But Bill Hutchinson had no
weapon except a hatchet which he carried
in his belt.</p>

<p>There now came a rattling sound and a
jingling as though something had dropped
to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are forcing the door,&#8221; whispered
Ned Chandler.</p>

<p>The boys pressed forward, cautiously, but
with more speed. The door of the house
was open; as they stood beside it, not sure
of their next movement, and not wanting
to make a false one, there came a sudden
and startling scream from the interior. At
this they sprang inside, the derringers and
the tomahawk held ready for use.</p>

<p>Upon their appearance there came a shot
and a confusion of voices which Walter and
Ned recognized as those of Huntley and
Barker. Then there was a smashing of
glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way!&#8221; cried the voice of Colonel
Huntley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s going through the window at the
other side of the house,&#8221; cried Ned.</p>

<p>The three lads darted out, and around
the house. Under some trees not far from
the trail were a dozen or more mounted
men. Huntley was running toward these,
the fainting form of a girl in his arms.</p>

<p>Like young panthers both Walter and
Ned sprang upon him; he dropped the girl
under the weight of their attack, and with
the fury of a giant fought them off. Barker
scrambled upon his horse, and his voice
was now heard shouting to the Mexicans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot, you yellow idiots! Why don&#8217;t
you shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars to the man who
gets the girl!&#8221; came the voice of Sam
Davidge.</p>

<p>Rifles and small arms were flung forward
in the moonlight; Huntley drew a derringer
and advanced upon the boys. But
before a shot could be fired there came a
rush of hoofs; old Dolph, Jed Curley and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
dozen more, with Sid Hutchinson in their
midst, dashed upon the scene.</p>

<p>Huntley, seeing them, leaped upon his
horse and, after firing a wild shot at the
boys from the pistol, wheeled his mount
and tore away down the trail with the
Mexicans.</p>

<p>Like the wind, Dolph, Jed and Sid
Hutchinson and their party tore by in
pursuit. From the distance came the
sound of hoofs and the rattle of shots;
then the boys lifted up the fainting Ethel
Norton and carried her back to the house.</p>

<small>THE BATTLE OF THE ALAMO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scream and the pistol shot had
awakened Mrs. Allison; and when the boys
appeared in the doorway with the fainting
girl, she was awaiting them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put her down there,&#8221; she directed
calmly, pointing to a couch covered with a
huge buffalo robe.</p>

<p>Under the attentions of Mrs. Allison,
who was one of the women of the border,
and had been for years accustomed to
sudden dangers and calls for help, Ethel
Norton quickly revived. In a very little
while she had recovered from her fright
and was able to talk; and then Bill Hutchinson
introduced Walter and Ned, and they
told their story once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the girl, when she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
heard it all and realized the nature of the
danger she had just escaped, &#8220;how can people
be so cruel and so wicked! And,&#8221;
looking from one to the other of them,
&#8220;how can I thank you all for what you
have done for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were still talking the situation over
eagerly when the sound of horses&#8217; hoofs
came from the trail. It was the party
under old Dolph and Jed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They never stopped,&#8221; cried Sid Hutchinson
as he slid from the horse of Jed, for
he had been mounted behind that adventurer.
&#8220;They fired back at us, but kept
right on running.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means,&#8221; said Jed, with a laugh, &#8220;all
of them that were able to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of Huntley and Davidge and
Barker?&#8221; asked Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>Old Dolph shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are among the ones not able to,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;You youngsters need never be
uneasy about them varmints any more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>For about a week after this Ethel Norton
was quite ill, and still another week passed
before she felt able to travel; and the boys
remained in San Antonio watching the
preparations going on for receiving Santa
Anna and his army; and also preparing
for their own long journey across the plains
toward the Red River.</p>

<p>Davy Crockett gave them much good advice
upon this point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a few days,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I think a
party will be going your way and you can
join them. And if there is not, we&#8217;ll have
old Dolph guide you back. We can spare
one man, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys waited well into the third week;
but there was no sign of a party traveling
in this direction. So Crockett consulted
with Travis, Bowie and old Dolph, and it
was decided that they delay no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were sent to get the girl to Louisville,&#8221;
said Crockett to the boys, &#8220;and I
guess you&#8217;d better do it right away. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
country as unsettled as this one is, too
much delay is dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are going to stay, colonel?&#8221;
said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as Texas has a foe out in the
open, I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; replied the backwoodsman.
&#8220;Some day I may go back to Tennessee;
but that all depends on how things go with
me. War, you know,&#8221; and he smiled in his
droll way, &#8220;is a mighty uncertain thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the remainder of that day the
boys, together with the Hutchinson brothers
and old Dolph, looked to their arms and
horses. A mustang was presented to Ethel
by Colonel Crockett; and at noon on the
day following the girl, the veteran Texan
and the four boys mounted and waved a
good-bye to the heroes they were leaving
behind&mdash;and heroes they were&mdash;heroes such
as the world has seldom seen.</p>

<p>Upon the day on which the young travelers
recrossed the Colorado, sentinels upon
a roof top at San Antonio noted the advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of a Mexican force. It proved to be
Santa Anna with an army of seven thousand
men. The Texans quickly retreated
across the river to the Franciscan mission
buildings, known as the Alamo. For there
were only one hundred and fifty men in
the garrison, and they could not hope to
face seven thousand in the open.</p>

<p>The Alamo buildings consisted of a
church, with a convent and hospital behind
it. Then there was a yard enclosed
by a stone wall. The entire place was too
much for so small a force to defend; so
Travis very wisely stationed his men in the
church, which was a stone structure with
powerful walls and facing the river and
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have fourteen guns mounted on the
walls,&#8221; said the young North Carolinian as
he swept the plaza before the mission with
his keen eyes. &#8220;And I reckon the Mexicans
will know they&#8217;ve been in a fight if
they ever get within reach of them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Behind these cannon the Texan riflemen
awaited the movements of the force
of Santa Anna. That commander at once
grouped his guns in battery formation and
opened fire; the defenders of the Alamo
replied with their guns; but their deadly
rifles were the most effective weapon; with
them they picked off the gunners as berries
are picked from a bush.</p>

<p>Travis, while the way was yet open, sent
out a message to the Texas government
asking that aid be sent them. All the time
the force of the Mexicans was growing
larger. Colonel Fannin set out from Goliad
with three hundred men and four
pieces of artillery, to the aid of the Texans
at the Alamo. But he had little provision,
his ammunition wagon broke down, and
he hadn&#8217;t enough oxen to get his cannon
across the river. Fannin at length gave up
the attempt and returned to Goliad. However,
a bold leader, at the head of thirty-two
daring followers, arrived on the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of March first and slipped through the
Mexican lines. This was Captain Smith
and his little command from Gonzales; and
the defenders welcomed them with cheers.</p>

<p>On March fourth Travis sent off a last
message to the Texan authorities; this was
carried by the brave Captain Smith, who
set his comrades&#8217; lives above his own safety.
The message said in part:</p>

<p>&#8220;... although we may be sacrificed to
the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory
will cost that enemy so dear that it
will be worse than a defeat.... A
blood red flag waves from the church of
Bexer and in the camp above us, in token
that the war is one of vengeance against
rebels. These threats have had no influence
upon my men but to make all fight
with desperation and with that high souled
courage which characterizes the patriot who
is willing to die for his country; liberty
and his own honor; God and Texas; victory
or death!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>On the day following the sending of this
message, Santa Anna assembled his troops
for an assault upon the Alamo; but it was
not until the succeeding day that the attack
was delivered. Twenty-five hundred
troops were divided into four columns commanded
by Colonels Duque, Romero and
Morales; they had bars, axes and scaling
ladders. All the Mexican cavalry were
drawn up around the mission to see that
no one escaped.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the four columns,
at the sound of the bugle, dashed forward;
the Texan cannon and the long rifles spat
death in their faces. The column under
Duque recoiled from the north wall, their
commander badly wounded. East and
west the attack also failed; the Mexicans
swarmed in a shouting mob upon the north
side. Their officers shouted and struck at
them, forcing them to scale the walls.
Once more the sleet of bullets from the
American rifles came forth, and once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the attackers fell back. But again the
officers forced them to the walls; this time
they scaled it and fell over it in crowds.
By sheer weight of numbers they forced
the Texans across the convent yard and
into the hospital.</p>

<p>The captured cannon were turned upon
the &#8217;dobe walls of the hospital and smashed
them in; a howitzer, loaded with musket
balls and broken iron, was fired into the
building and the Texans fell like sheep.
Then a desperate hand-to-hand conflict
ensued. Crockett, Travis and Bonham
fought like the heroes of old. Knife, pistol
and clubbed rifle played their parts. Jim
Bowie had been wounded while defending
the wall early in the fight. He lay upon
a bed, coolly firing one pistol after another
as the Mexicans showed themselves. But
he was finally killed by a musket shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_198.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A DESPERATE HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT ENSUED</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>From room to room fought the Texans,
contesting every step of the way; the proof
of their desperation is the great number of
Mexicans who fell in this bloody close-quarters
fight; forty-five bodies were
counted in one spot after all was over.</p>




<p>Travis fell here, and so did the brave
Colonel Bonham. With his loved rifle
clubbed in his hands and with many a foeman
stretched beside him, fell that gallant
Tennessean, Davy Crockett, defending a
doorway. Like fiends, the Mexicans, urged
by the bloody minded Santa Anna, stabbed
and shot, and when the fight was done,
every Texan in the Alamo was dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>News traveled slowly in those days and
the boys had reached the Mississippi once
more, they had said good-bye to Sid and
Bill Hutchinson and Dolph, and were
about to embark upon a steamboat for
Louisville, when a New Orleans newspaper
caught their eyes. And in it they saw the
first news of the fall of the Alamo, and of
the noble death of Colonel Crockett.</p>

<p>Ethel Norton was as shocked at the news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
as they were, for the boys had been telling
her of the backwoodsman&#8217;s good nature and
rare qualities of heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think,&#8221; said she, the big tears
starting in her eyes, &#8220;that all his high
hopes should end in death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it will not be for nothing,&#8221; said
Walter Jordan. &#8220;Men like Colonel Crockett
and Travis and Bowie do not die this
way without making a stir. Who knows
but their death will so arouse Texas and
the Texans that they will not wait to be
attacked&mdash;that it may make them carry the
war to Santa Anna, and so set their country
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was not long after the three had
arrived in Louisville, and Ethel Norton
with the services of the elder Mr. Jordan
had proved her identity, that news from
far-away Texas showed Walter&#8217;s judgment
to have been good. Texas had declared
herself free; Santa Anna had marched
another army against her, and was met by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
a force under the celebrated Sam Houston
on the San Jacinto River. The Mexicans
were utterly defeated, Santa Anna was a
prisoner, and the Lone Star flag had taken
its place among the emblems of the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF DAVID CROCKETT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">David Crockett</span> was born August 17,
1786, at Rogersville, Tennessee. He came
of Irish ancestry, his grandparents settling
in Pennsylvania. Afterward they traveled
southwest and made their home in what
was then the wilderness of Tennessee. In
one of the almost countless Indian attacks
upon the settlers they were both killed.</p>

<p>It is not known if John Crockett, their
son, and father of David, was born on the
ocean crossing to America, or in Ireland.
At any rate, he grew up in America, and
fought gallantly in the Revolution.</p>

<p>He married a Mary Hankins who lived
in that rich farming region near the town
of York, Pa. They had three daughters
and six sons; David was the fifth child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and first saw the light of day on the banks
of the Nolachuky River, Tennessee.</p>

<p>At the age of eight years David was engaged
by a drover to help take care of his
cattle. But after two weeks on the road he
ran away, joined a wagon train and returned
home.</p>

<p>Soon after this young Davy got into a
scrape at school. He had a fight with a
boy much larger and older than himself
and thrashed him; then, fearing what the
schoolmaster would say, he played truant.
When Davy&#8217;s father heard of this he sought
out his son. But the boy eluded him. And
so we find him in the situation of fearing
to go to school and also fearing to go home.
So he ran away, engaged with another
drover and traveled into Virginia.</p>

<p>The boy drifted about the country for a
time, working for drovers and wagoners;
once at Baltimore he was upon the point of
going to sea, but the teamster with whom he
was then engaged refused to allow him to go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>After suffering a great deal of bad usage,
he made up his mind to go back home to
Tennessee. To escape a whipping at the
hands of his father he had endured hardships
that were worse than a thousand
whippings. He dreaded what they&#8217;d say
to him and more than once hesitated on
the journey home. But he was welcomed
with open arms.</p>

<p>Now came the time for Davy to show the
stuff he was made of; his father was in
debt, and the boy, now large and strong
and fifteen years of age, set to work to pay
this off. It was accomplished in a year&#8217;s
time, and by hard, steady toil, such as
none of the family had ever dreamed him
capable of.</p>

<p>The boy up to this time had little or no
education; and so he set about getting one.
In six months he had learned to read and
write and do sums in arithmetic; this was
all the schooling he ever had.</p>

<p>And through all this time the woods offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the young man a fair chance to gratify
his love for wandering and hunting.
Little by little his skill grew, and before
many years he was considered the most
deadly marksman in all Tennessee.</p>

<p>While still very young, Crockett married
an Irish girl, Polly Finlay; and they began
their housekeeping in a log cabin. Attracted
by the hunting grounds and an opportunity
to better his condition in life, he,
his wife, and two boys later crossed the
mountains with their household goods into
Lincoln County and settled on Elk River.</p>

<p>Here in this paradise of the hunter
Crockett&#8217;s skill grew and grew. There were
many mighty hunters in that day, but not
one whose celebrity approached that of
Crockett.</p>

<p>But then the second war with England
came on; Tecumseh rallied the Indian
tribes against the white settlers who had begun
to occupy their hunting grounds.</p>

<p>The Creek chief, Weatherford, attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Fort Mimms with a war party of fifteen
hundred braves. The fort was taken by
surprise, and out of the garrison of two
hundred and seventy-five only seventeen
escaped.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the Creek War.
General Andrew Jackson was made commander
of the American army sent against
the savages. And in this army Crockett
served as a volunteer.</p>

<p>During the campaign against the Creeks,
Crockett undertook many dangerous scouting
trips and took part in the battle of Tallushatchee,
and also that of Taladega. His
daring brought him prominently before the
public eye in all the movements of the army
against the Indians. Afterward he re&euml;nlisted
and joined Russell&#8217;s Spies, with
whom he performed many difficult feats of
enterprise and courage. After the battle of
Enotochopko his time again expired, and
once more he re&euml;nlisted and fought to the
end of the Creek War.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>Two years after his return home his wife
died; and not a great while afterward he
married once more. It was about this time
that he went upon an exploring expedition
into the Creek country, where he was taken
dangerously ill.</p>

<p>Later he removed with his family into
the section bought by the government from
the Chickasaw Nation. He established a
home at the head of Shoal Creek, and was
shortly after elected justice of the peace,
and later still, colonel of a regiment of
frontier militia.</p>

<p>As time went on, Crockett grew more and
more in the public eye; he was just the sort
of picturesque character that would please
the rough and ready settlers; his marksmanship,
his ready, backwoods eloquence made
him the popular choice and he was sent to
the Legislature. Afterward he ran for Congress
and was defeated.</p>

<p>But it takes more than a single defeat to
discourage a man like Crockett; and so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
following election he ran again and was
elected. He created a sensation in Washington
during his stay in the city during his
first and second terms as a Congressman.
All the big cities of the east were also delighted
to greet and entertain him upon one
occasion when he visited them. But on his
third attempt for the Congressional seat, he
was defeated. Then he went to Texas.</p>

<p>There is not a great deal known of Colonel
Crockett&#8217;s trip across the plains to the
town of San Antonio; and even less of his
doings after he got there. But that he
fought as brave a fight as any of the other
heroic defenders of the Alamo, those who
knew him best were positive; and his name
will live always in the annals of the Great
West.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
